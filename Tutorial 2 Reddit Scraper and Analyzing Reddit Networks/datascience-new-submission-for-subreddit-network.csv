Have posted this in another (corporate) community but primarily interested in what the responses are from data scientists. FWIW Im not necessarily a DS have worked majority of the time in greenfield data teams where my role has been to set up nascent data teams that work across everything in the data continuum re Reporting/ dashboarding, analytics / insights (massively underrated and my favorite component tbh) and  data science / advanced analytics with the former and latter being project based and set and forget and analytics being a day to day function where we work closely with the business. Anyway that is just to say that Im a jack of all trades master of none and happy to be moving away from the programming side (which I think would be a minority view on this sub)



Anyway, personally my best manager was never there, gave us massive amounts of credit for work that we did (usually in a open forum) and autonomy to do the work as we wished. They were very good at their job I imagine as they would always drop in from time to time and ask good questions but were generally not really directly involved in the team in the traditional sense. Never really gave you work or delegated it but rather suggested what should be done or what would be 'cool' if it existed and hinted at it that way. Had a very intense manner about them but were also very passive as mentioned before. Also were very innovative in all aspects of their work and this extended to how they managed people. Two cool things that they implemented that were not related to work per se but for some reason really resonated and made it feel like the team was all about development and growth (which it was) were:

a) established an in-team book club whereby we would read a book per month and discuss over lunch

b) had about 20 direct reports but regardless of seniority set up a mentorship program for their DRs whereby he matched them with snr people that he had worked with in the past (think head of and above) and basically encouraged us to pick their brains etc.

Basically managed as if he wanted everyone to get promoted and replace him and even though my we worked in a technical area , he emphaisised the importance of soft skills, personal branding etc and always put people in a position to showcase themselves etc. Otherwise as mentioned was present at about 10% of our stand ups and I generally would not have been surprised if he was at the pub a decent chunk of the time, or working on presenting at various external showcases etc . Seems he was attendant at a lot of the day to day meetings between heads of to make the big decisions and was very much present for the team when it was needed that someone take the blame (which he himself wore).

I could imagine some people may find things like the book club cringe but they were done in such a way that showed that they were interested in our growth beyond work, and this made most of the team want to run through a wall for him.

**Next**: Besides ELT, we heard from a large chunk of our community that **you hate governance** but it's an obstacle to data usage so you want to learn how to do it right. Well, it's no rocket/data science, so we arranged to have a professional lawyer/data protection officer give a webinar for data engineers, to help them achieve compliance.

The PDFs are servicing guides. Examples of them can be seen from the following site: [https://servicing-guide.fanniemae.com/](https://servicing-guide.fanniemae.com/)

Now regex is not usable since these items are varied in nature and are sometimes inside table and there are no fixed positions in the document where these compliance items can be situated.

The goal is to train a LLM model on these compliance documents so that if I provide a new PDF it can predict/extract compliance items from it.

Can anyone guide me in which model will be better suited for this task, what tokenizers etc and if there are similar scenarios/methodologies for extracting the items?

I’m thrilled to announce the release of Plotlars 0.3.0! 🚀

This new version brings a host of exciting features and improvements designed to make your data visualization experience in Rust even smoother and more powerful. If you’ve been following the progress of Plotlars, you’ll know that it’s all about bridging the gap between the Polars data analysis library and various plotting libraries. With this release, we’re taking things to the next level!

# What’s New in Plotlars 0.3.0?

**🚀 New Features:**

* **From Trait for Text:** We've implemented the \`From\` trait for \`Text\`, allowing seamless conversion from \`&str\`, \`&String\`, and \`String\`. This makes handling text elements in your plots more intuitive and less error-prone.
* **Plot Title Position:** Now, you have more control over your plot's aesthetics with the ability to customize the title position. Whether you want it centered, aligned left, or right, the choice is yours.
* **Axis Customization:** We’ve added an axis module that gives you greater flexibility in customizing your plot axes. Tailor your axes to match the precise look and feel you need for your data visualization.
* **Write HTML Method:** Need to export your plots? The new \`write\_html\` method makes it easy to save your visualizations as interactive HTML files, perfect for sharing or embedding in reports.

# Check It Out!

Head over to the crate, explore the updated documentation, and dive into the GitHub repository to see all the new changes in action. If you find Plotlars useful, consider leaving a star ⭐️ on [GitHub](https://github.com/alceal/plotlars) —it helps others discover the project and motivates further development.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in Plotlars. Happy plotting! 🎉

I am actually trying to find the best team in a sport based on some stats. The worst part is I don’t have win data, so I actually need to find a balanced team that could perform the best.

I need to make sure I choose a team that has the best attacking and defensive stats. All I could think of was choosing based on descriptive stats, so I was wondering if I could do it with ML. Of course, there might be no need, but I was curious: if I must use ML, how can I do it? I was thinking about using feature importance with random forest regression to find the weightage and then multiplying it by the stats to find the team with the best median. But I’m not sure if this is even remotely correct. I would appreciate any thoughts.

* Extensible API: define custom metrics and use statistical tests of your choice.
* Detailed documentation.

We are having an issue, in my company, where we are starting new projects and we want to do it from zero. We've been having issues with the development environments and their easy to use. Recently, the company has decided to cut off everything with conda, so we cannot create no more data environments with conda.

I'm experienced with pipenv and dockers, but since we are going to use a window server for the deploy, tools dpt refuses to create a docker for windows since they need to maintain it updated (and in their heads, maintaining the docker image is a pain in the ass too for this reason). So we need to work with the environments and make them easy to use.

I suggested using poetry, since it's a powerful library and environment manager, but some data scientist need a little bit of learning in this area (we have some industrial engineers reconverted as data scientist from inside the company). Another thing that is creating problems is the dependency management. We have some projects that use super niche libraries. Those libraries are legacy and use a pandas version (pandas for example) that is very old. Conda worked for us because it let us have 2 versions of pandas, one is the updated one and the other is the dependency for the niche library that we use.

I am often the technical lead on projects, working alongside consulting generalists. As a result, I set the analytical agenda and can direct some junior teammates. Ideally they would execute parts of the analysis, but the skills just don't fit. So I handle the analysis and write up the findings.

Awkwardly, these junior teammates wind up in higher-stakes roles where they can feel their way through. Think project management or writing executive summaries-- the things the client actually reads. This distribution of responsibilities feels backwards. And their part still requires a lot input / rework from me, because the results need to be just so and depend on knowledge of what I am doing.

These are reasonably diligent and skilled workers; I just haven't figured out how to use them! Appreciate your perspectives.

**Edit:** Your great responses make me reframe my problem.

I work on a generalist consulting team. They do strategy, facilitation, project management support, communications, etc., and the client and company like their work. I can make no assumptions about basic quantitative or data familiarity. They are not budding analysts trying to learn. They do something valuable and different.

I am the square peg they call when a project demands analysis. I need support to get it done, but as a team we struggle to marshal resources for that purpose. Even after talking through results in business terms, it is clear that some teammates are not  grasping the message. The misunderstandings show up in deliverables, often masked under techno-babble that must be removed or corrected.

Nonetheless, leadership and clients seem to love the result so far. I just worry that it is not sustainable, and that something important will get lost in translation.

We were recently told that there's probably going to be some loose money in the budget and that if there were any certifications, bootcamps, or conferences we were interested in that would support our work, we should bring it up with our manager.

We're an eclectic bunch. I'm the only one with a formal DS degree (master's); my other two colleagues have experience in economics and systems. Our skillsets are mismatched, which is fine because we're a collaborative team and can delegate tasks according to strengths. However, we've all agreed that we'd like to continue with refining our already existing skills or learning new ones. Frankly, we're all probably going to end up leaving our government-adjacent jobs for the private sector, so we're also interested in more marketable skills like Hadoop, SAS, PostgreSQL, Polars, etc. 

I know bootcamps are hit or miss (mostly misses). One of my colleagues has suggested a bootcamp hosted at a nearby university. It looks decent, all things considered, but most of it would be useless for me and there's only one portion I'd actually benefit from. It's very much a ""let's try to teach you everything possible in 6 months"" bootcamp, so a lot of redundancy for me and one of my other colleagues. I'm looking for alternative suggestions to counter this one.

Ultimately, we're looking for resources that are efficient and more targeted/customisable and more nuanced than just ""learn data science"" or ""learn Python"" that we can pitch to the great rusty cogs of government bureaucracy to take advantage of some extra funding. Ideally one-offs like a weekend workshop or conference, or online through an independent agency or a university.

- classification problem 
- class label format A-B (example X-2)
- precision acceptance criteria of 0.85 at class level 

<Situation>
Documents tagged to sub class X used to train binary classifier X; likewise for binary classifier 2. 

At inference time, a new document is fed into model X-2 and model, and what returns is the predicted probabilities from model X and model 2. 

Because of the way the models are trained, they don't learn dependence between child classes. With the assumption of independence, the joint probability of the new document belonging to class X-2 is P( X-2 | document) = P(subclass X | document) P(subclass 2 | document). 

Because performance metric is required at parent class level, threshold tuning is then applied to the joint probabilities to attain acceptance criteria for performance metric for parent class X-2. 

<Questions>
- Has anyone experience combining probabilities from child models to obtain the final prediction? Are there any logical flaws in threshold tuning after combining predictions from child models, when performance metric is required at parent model?
- I was thinking deeply about how to inject dependence between sub classes while training binary classifiers for each sub class, and this thought came up in my mind and I'm not sure if it's right? - If you want dependence between sub classes, it means you want precise combined predictions. To improve precision, you can threshold tune the combined predictions to the desired precision level. Hence, you're kind of injecting dependence between sub classes by threshold tuning.

They have lots of internal data about their customers (USA small businesses), but for this project, they might need to augment their internal data with external 3rd party data.

I'll probably want to purchase:  
– firmographic data (revenue, number of employees, etc)  
– technographic data (i.e., what technologies and systems they use)

I did some fairly extensive research yesterday, and it seems like you can purchase this type of data from Equifax and Experian.

It seems like we might be able to purchase some other data from Dun & Bradstreet (although their product offers are very complicated, and I'm not exactly sure what they provide).

Ultimately, I have some idea where to find this type of data, but I'm unsure about the best sources, possible pitfalls, etc?

**Questions:**

1. What are the best sources for purchasing B2B firmographic and technographic data?
2. What issues and pitfalls should I be thinking about?

Picking the right metric and understanding it is one of the most important parts of data science work. However, I've seen that this is rarely taught in courses or university degrees. Even senior data scientists often have only a basic understanding of metrics.

The idea of the book is to be this little handbook that lives on top of every data scientist's desk for quick reference of the most known metric, ahem, *accuracy,* to the most obscure thing (looking at you, *P4-metric)*

The book will cover the following types of metrics:

* Regression
* Classification
* Clustering
* Ranking
* Vision
* Text
* GenAI
* Bias and Fairness
