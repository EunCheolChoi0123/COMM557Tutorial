I'm writing these silly ""poems"" as part of a book that I'm working on called: ""The Little Book of ML Metrics"".

Here is a sample page for Recall. Let me know if you would like to see any specific metric :)

Like do they need to solve hard  sql questions quickly to pass? Or if they show they can but struggle to get correct answer, or take more time to solve then would you still hire them? 

Of course it depends on candidates, but i was curious how much weightage as HM you give to coding round and expectations are, for high paying entry level roles. 

Also, whatâ€™s ideal time to solve the answer medium and hard SQL questions

Edit- interested to know when some companies have 5-7 rounds (3-4 interviews in just one super day) as needs to know how much importance do you give to product sense interviews or coding interviews 

Edit -2 i meant while solving Hard level code sql questions. Because i think if you can show you can solve medium questions, and have projects that did use sql, but struggle to do hard ones then what happens

And how can you make HM believe that its just because of anxiety and nerves issue on solving hard questions live, bcz on interviews sometimes you just donâ€™t get idea or get hard time under the question 

Edit -3 seems like post is confusing people, again i was interested to know candidate struggling to solve hard SQL questions but they can solve medium questions and know enough like windows, ctes, joins etc. ",False,False,datascience,"In SQL round, When do you not select a candidate?

To be honest I've always thought that this kind of analysis is kind of sketchy (but appealing to the business, I know), since someone doing it naturally is different compared to if you were pushed artificially to do something (especially when coupon/discounts are involved). I stumbled upon markov chain/path analysis, but yeah I still can't shake off the feeling that its a weird/snake-oil ish kind of thing.
