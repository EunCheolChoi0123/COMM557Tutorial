Picking the right metric and understanding it is one of the most important parts of data science work. However, I've seen that this is rarely taught in courses or university degrees. Even senior data scientists often have only a basic understanding of metrics.

The idea of the book is to be this little handbook that lives on top of every data scientist's desk for quick reference of the most known metric, ahem, *accuracy,* to the most obscure thing (looking at you, *P4-metric)*

The book will cover the following types of metrics:

* Regression
* Classification
* Clustering
* Ranking
* Vision
* Text
* GenAI
* Bias and Fairness

Essentially, using data drift as a proxy for performance monitoring is not a great idea.

  
I wanted to prove that by giving data drift methods a second chance and trying to get the most out of them. I built a technique that relies on drift signals to estimate model performance and compared its results against the current SoTA performance estimation methods ([PAPE \[arxiv link\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08348) and [CBPE \[docs link\]](https://nannyml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_it_works/performance_estimation.html#confidence-based-performance-estimation-cbpe)) to see which technique performs best.

  
To effectively compare data drift signals against performance estimation methods, I used an evaluation framework that emulates a typical production ML model and ran multiple dataset-model experiments.

As per data, I used datasets from the [Folktables package](https://github.com/socialfoundations/folktables). (Folktables preprocesses US census data to create a set of binary classification problems.) To make sure the results are not biased, in terms of the nature of the model, I trained different types of models (Linear, Ensemble Boosting) for multiple prediction tasks included in Folktables.

Then, I built a technique that relies on drift signals to estimate model performance. This method uses univariate and multivariate data drift information as features of a DriftSignal model to estimate the performance of the model we monitor. It works as follows:

1. Fit univariate/multivariate drift detection calculator on reference data (test set).

1. Take the fitted calculators to measure the observed drift in the production set. For univariate drift detection methods, we use Jensen Shannon, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Chi2 distance metrics/tests. Meanwhile, we use the [PCA Reconstruction Error](https://nannyml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_it_works/multivariate_drift.html#data-reconstruction-with-pca) and [Domain Classifier](https://nannyml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_it_works/multivariate_drift.html#domain-classifier) for multivariate methods.

1. Build a DriftSignal model that trains a regression algorithm using the drift results from the reference period as features and the monitored model performance as a target.

1. Estimate the performance of the monitored model on the production set using the trained DriftSignal model.

You can find the full implementation of this method in this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/santiviquez/aa224c6e232c8bd2534893888981564d).

  
Then, for evaluation, I used a modified version of MAE because I needed an aggregated version that take into consideration the standard deviation of the errors. To account for this, I scale absolute/squared errors by the standard error (SE) calculated for each evaluation case. We call the SE-scaled metrics **mean absolute standard error (MASTE)**.

[MASTE formula](https://preview.redd.it/7jnk40il2l3d1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=19679d6a202b2175f75c6f3252430792682090ad)

  
Then it was a matter of running all the 580 experiments and collect results.

Since, each performance estimation method is trying to estimate the roc\_auc of the monitored model, I report the MASTE between the estimated and realized roc\_auc.

https://preview.redd.it/z0oviz763l3d1.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0e4838dcadbf664ff59570997f46612002c7e6e

PAPE seems to be the most accurate method, followed by CBPE. Surprisingly, constant test set performance is the third best. This is closely followed by random forest versions of univariate and multivariate drift signal models.

  
This plot shows the quality of performance estimation among different methods, including PAPE and CBPE.

[Quality of performance estimation \(MASTE of roc\_auc\) vs absolute performance change \(SE\). \(The lower, the better\).](https://preview.redd.it/3ar6plzbyk3d1.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c429a6c35daf887fff021bd4f9894a15caac7a57)

  
Here is a specific time series plot of a model's realized ROC AUC (black) compared against all the performance estimation methods. PAPE (red) accurately estimates the direction of the most significant performance change and closely approximates the magnitude.

[Time series plot of realized vs estimated roc\_auc for dataset ACSIncome \(California\) and LigthGBM model.](https://preview.redd.it/m6igkfmk3l3d1.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=6146b84f4999b70fa618ade15084dda8fea2acc8)

The experiments suggest that there are better tools for detecting performance degradation than data drift, even though I tried my best to extract all the meaningful information from drift signals to create an accurate performance estimation method.

There are better tools for quantifying the impact of data drift on model performance. So, I hope this helps the industry realize that monitoring fine-grained metrics leads to nothing and that a change in an obscure feature might not mean anything. It is better to first estimate model performance and then, if it drops, review data drift results but not the other way around.

In other words, they try to learn how to model an outcome 'y' given the input variables 'X'. 

This probability distribution, P(y|X), is also called Concept. Therefore, if the Concept changes, the model may become invalid.

But how do we know if there is a new Concept in our data?

Or, more importantly, how do we measure if the new Concept is affecting the model's performance?

Here is a clever solution where the main ingredients are a reference dataset, one where the model's performance is known, and a dataset with the latest data we would like to monitor.

**Step-by-Step solution:**

1. We start by training an internal model on a chunk of the latest data. -> This allows us to learn the new possible Concept presented in the data.

2. Next, we use the internal model to make predictions on the reference dataset.

3. We then estimate the model's performance on the reference dataset, assuming the model's predictions on the monitoring data as ground truth.

4. If the estimated performance of the internal model and the actual monitored model are very different, we then say that there has been a Concept Drift.

To quantify how this Concept impacts performance, we subtract the actual model's performance on reference from the estimated performance and report a delta of the performance metric. -> This is what the plot below shows. The change of the F1-score due to Concept drift! 

This process is repeated for every new chunk of data that we get.

When I mix bboying with calistenic for me its harder to have a good quality in one.

I'm managing a DS/ML team in my company, and we've been picking up a couple of projects that uses LLM.

To date, I see that for the applications happening inside the company, using LLM APIs (OpenAI, Google, etc) and building systems around it (RAG, guardrails, prompting, you name it) is still the way to go because of:

- Speed to iterate

- Fine-tuning data not readily available

- The current + foreseeable future use cases seems to be able to be solved using ""general knowledge"" contained in the big tech's pretraining + instruct-tuning

I still see fine-tuning being thrown around by either the big tech sales people (I get it, they're sales function at the end of the day) or by senior leadership that knows a bit into the details behind these LLMs, but personally I don't see a specific value yet of doing fine-tuning at my company's scale.



The reasons I can think of on why someone in my position resorts to fine tuning is:

- If there is an available infrastructure + team managing it already, and serving our own fine-tuned model is cheaper (economy of scale).

- Compliance issues (eg. maybe Banks really don't want to risk their data being sent to other company's server)

- Risk of the model's response stability being at the hand of the provider

- If the task is proven to be too specific, and even GPT-4/Opus/Gemini-1.5 with RAG, etc can't solve (or the modifications around it becoming too expensive)



Based on your experience, is there a major reason that I miss? Another recent data point is Cognition labs.

I started in earnest about September of 2022, having purchased some wood a few months previously. Turns out the wood I picked for the laminated section of the bench top was very green and wet, and even with 8 weeks of drying in my very dry and hot garage, it still wasn’t enough. Once it was glued up, the entire bench top developed a wicked twist. It also so full of knots that after 2 weeks of trying to hand plane it flat, I gave up and started over with kiln dried wood, and was more rigorous in my selection process, now that I knew what to look for. The other mistake I made on my first glue up was not noticing the grain directions, so I’d get a good smooth plane run on one plank, and some savage tear out on its neighbor. For the second iteration, I marked all the grain directions and glued them correctly and the flat planing it was a dream.

For the legs, I made the same mistake with buying raw green Douglas fir 4x4s. Some of them twisted and split so badly, once they were fully dried, I decided to use some epoxy to fill and stabilize the cracks. Time will tell how that pans out.

The mortices and tenons were brutal, probably the most fun but also most time consuming part of the whole build, speaking as a beginner.

I was actually a bit shocked when I finally got the legs and rails together and they were more or less flat and could stand alone. 

By the time I got to making the well board, I was so tired of knotty pines and firs, I picked a nice hardwood plank, like beech or ash. It was so much easier to work with, now that I had 8 months of experience with my fettling and sharpening the plane.

Most profound lesson I took from this was paying attention to plane sharpening. I realized 3 months in that I had my water stone grits mixed up and had been sharpening and the then dulling my blade.

I've been trying to encourage my friends to grow peppers and tomatoes, but the resources available on growing them seem to overwhelmingly apply to growing them in temperate climates in the US. So I've come to you for advice. 

To start, my friends live in the Hayward (East Bay Area), Los Angeles, and Rancho Mirage (low desert, near Joshua Tree). In no location does the soil ever go below freezing. There is some temperature stress in the form of colder (<50 F) temps between November and Feb, and at night in the bay. In rancho mirage, temperatures regularly climb above 105 F during the day for months, and it is not unusual for them to ocassionally surpass 110-120 F. 

  
There is also the issue of house design and growing space. As you might imagine, land in CA is at a premium in these cities, and the houses themselves are designed to place whatever arable space is available out of continuously direct sunight.

All the plants they've planted have been, well, disappointing. Despite planting in April, only the bay area tomatoes have survived. However, these tomatoes are just now starting to grow some fruits. They are not as abundant per plant as hoped, with perhaps one or two fruits each. Only the peppers planted in the bay area are doing well, although it took 4-5 months before they started producing. 

I'm not sure what resources to send to them, or advice to give. I know sunlight and rootspace may be a factor, but what advice do I give my Rancho Mirage folks? Will tomatoes even grow during the ultra hot summers? Does this mean the growing season for them is shifted?

With the stargate franchise, especially earlier seasons, for the most part I'm willing to look past the visuals because the story is compelling enough. 

But I can't help wondering how hard it would be to go back and spruce up some of the rougher scenes. For example: S8 Ep 21 Lost City parts 1 & 2, the scene with O'neil activating the chair on Proclarush Teonas, there's a little hologram animation of the Earth's continents shifting over 30 million years. You can clearly tell the animator's took a simplified approach to showing this. No doubt the choice was made due to either limited budgets or the oscillating nature of the science consultant's coupling to the writing team. 

And then again, maybe this is only bugging me cause I'm a geo professional, but the fact that the hologram shows the Baja peninsula existing over 30 Mya ago just bugs be a little. We have pretty accurate [global climate and geographical](https://youtu.be/UevnAq1MTVA) reconstructions going back much farther than that.

Anyways, I have a bit of work experience now and would like to start investing the other half, except for a 3 months run rate.

My wife and I adopted a dog from the animal shelter like 4 months ago. It was a lovely experience up to now, though the dog has been a bit extra difficult to train due to her past. But with patience and le Parfait we are getting there.

Anyway, all we know about this dog is that she was taken from her former owner by the police somewhere around 5 months of age, then trained at the shelter for 2-3 months, then we got her. She was clearly not socialized at all, was not trained until arriving at the shelter, and she is terrified of any object resembling a rolled up newspaper or an older man. So we have our suspicions she was definitely neglected and possibly abused, but we really don't know.

Now the weird part. About a week ago my wife got a call from an unknown number. OK actually it was 7 calls in one afternoon .The guy left some message saying he wanted to talk to her. We had no idea who this was so finally she picked up and guess what: it was the former owner. I mean, you already guessed it because that was the post title. He exactly identified the dog and knew her former name. My wife thought pretty well on her feet and was extremely diplomatic, while giving no information at all. But the guy clearly knew we had this dog. He said he had gotten our phone number from the Amicus chip number. This should not be possible, so someone screwed up somewhere. But I digress.

We do not have a clue what to do. We contacted the shelter and they said they had gotten the dog from a different Canton, so we should call that shelter. We called that shelter and they were completely unhelpful and said to go to the police. We filed a police report and they said that these are usually just old people getting the dog taken away so don't worry. 

The guy has called several times and left several messages since then. He says he just wants to know that the dog is OK.

Giving the guy the benefit of the doubt, we thought going to the police again was a bit overkill so maybe his local animal shelter, who had a part in seizing the dog in the first place, could place a courtesy call and tell the dude his dog is adopted out and is fine and to just chill out. But the shelter refused to do this.

Now we're left with either trying to deal with the guy directly, or going through the police. It would have of course been nice if the shelter had given some advice. After all, they know if this guy was some abusive monster or just a feeble old man who's a bit confused. But as said, they were zero help.

Ah, another detail. It's also possible he has our address. We aren't sure. It is stored in the Amicus database, but since we don't know how he got the phone number (only police, vet's, and shelters should have access as far as I understand) we can't say if he got the address too.

I guess I'm asking the crowd what you all would do. Maybe someone knows something or had a similar situation or just has a different perspective. Of course we discussed this with family and friends, but there was no clear consensus.

Train locomotive broke, replacement locomotive broke, air train broke, air train replacement bus broke, COVID testing infrastructure nonfunctional.

I'm from the states but live in Europe. I went back for about a month for Christmas and on my return trip, absolutely nothing seemed to work.

- COVID test. You need a COVID test within 72/24 hours of your flight (PCR/Antigen). Nowhere near my father's house offered antigen testing. In general, it was very hard to find a PCR test where the time frame worked (New Year's holiday) but I found a CVS with 1-2 days processing time. On the day of the flight results had not come. Calling them was not helpful. I decide to hurry and get a test at the airport. More below, but even today (almost 4 days later) the CVS results simply never came.

- Take the Amtrak to NYC. The train does not leave at departure time. 15 minutes later the conductor says the locomotive is broken, but no problem there's a spare. Another 20 minutes and he explains that the spare is unfortunately also broken, but apparently less broken so they are trying to fix it. Train finally leaves about 1.5 hours late. Train does not make up time because it has the top speed of a nice ride-on lawnmower.

- Get to JFK with not enough time. Terminal 8, free NYC COVID testing. It is a damn van under a bridge in 20 degree temperature and high winds with at least 100 people in line. I wait one hour losing feeling in my fingers trying to Google and call alternative test options and the line does not move. People are saying 3-4 hours but nobody knows.

- Go to departure terminal. Testing site there is gouging you $175 for an antigen test, but you wait indoors. Told 3 hour wait time. Thank god my airline rebooks me to a later flight. Wait 3 hours packed shoulder to shoulder in line and get negative result (and probably catch COVID).

- Need to go to another terminal. Air train is broken. Fine, there's a replacement bus. Board replacement bus, ride 20 meters, bus makes loud beeping noise and stops moving. Driver turns it on and off again a few times and is like ""well, she's dead."" Unloads passengers directly into traffic while another bus blocks it for us. Go back to bus stop and board another bus. Could hear the original guy on the bus radio still, he got it running but then it broke again. Poor guy.

The plane was thankfully from a foreign carrier and worked. The trains all worked on arrival in Zürich. The COVID test in Europe I got before departure had been processed while I waited. 

What is going on there? I'm not one to bash the US. I love the place. But come on man.

The website is [https://www.tackwallet.com](https://www.tackwallet.com) 

It's a personal finance app that makes it easy for couples and partners to stay on top of their finances.

  
The biggest pain points that my partner and I experienced when we were consolidating our finances were the following:

* Different ways of tracking our money
* Different POV when it comes to finances
* Existing options were too corporate and did not resonate with us as a couple

Then I thought, what if there was an app that, all you had to do was upload your CSV, and you were done?

* Categorization - DONE
* Management of different accounts - DONE
* Consolidation of dashboard and insights - DONE

I built this MVP as a way to solve my pain point and I believe there is a market for it, but would like to validate the idea. It's usable already with core features! :)

I even soft-launched it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1cht6yv/softlaunching_my_first_ever_webapp_called/) on the subreddit, hoping to get some feedback from you all. 

  
I was so excited to build out the actual idea, that I neglected to consider UI and UX. That's when my partner came into the picture.

I told her to be as critical as possible, thinking she was going to be able to use the rest of the app. Basically, it went down like this:

* Why is this so slow?
* I'm sorry, but with how it is now, you won't get me to use this.

  
As you can imagine, that was a **big blow to my ego and my ideas**. However, the thought of this still being a great idea (at least to me) lingered, and eventually, I was able to dig myself out of my hole of self-pity lol.

For the next 3 months (until today), I decided to work on a few things:

* Rewrite the whole app from ground up using Django, HTML/PHP, HTMX, and JS.
   * Had a hard time thinking of a more web-native solution, but since I was already very proficient with Python, I decided that Django was the least effort route for me
   * I also had to learn a lot about HTMX and JS as these were not as natural to me as Django and PHP
* Consider how things should feel and look like.
   * Although mobile responsiveness is still WIP, I think it looks and feels much better.
   * A few updates:
      * Fast rendering of everything
      * Async process of uploading files and categorizing expenses.
      * Notifications are a thing now
      * Before, all the bank/credit card accounts were managed with one app. Now, you invite another user into your group and if they accept, you will have access and visibility to their accounts as well.
      * Dashboards are more intuitive and I put more thought into how the insights should be presented.
      * Authentication is now google login. No manual emails needed.
      * Revamped landing page and blog (for content marketing)
      * Categorization is also very low effort now. It just works.

There are still some bugs and features to work out, but I think the MVP is in a great state, considering 3 months of after-work hours and weekends went into it (roughly 3 2-3 hr week nights and 1 weekend each week to so that I could stay sane).

Here is the transformation!

I've been pretty much a lurker here, soaking up all the inspiration and drive that I see from each post and redditor.

I'm a data scientist by profession, but a builder at heart. I've always been fascinated with web apps and SaaS projects, and although I've tried building some in the past, I've never really made it to the finish line (either losing steam, inspiration, drive, or realizing that I don't have the dev chops for what I wanted to build.

That's always been the case, until today! Today, I finished my landing page ([https://tackwallet.carrd.co/](https://tackwallet.carrd.co/)) and it, as well as my web app ([https://app.tackwallet.com/](https://app.tackwallet.com/)), are live! The very first prototype was a google sheets that I built to manage my family's finances across multiple bank accounts, credit cards, and income-earning family members.

My goal for posting here is to gather some feedback on the landing page and the MVP itself.

Here's the pitch--

**TackWallet** is a personal finance app that makes it easy for households, couples, groups, families, etc. to stay on top of their finances.

It tries to solve the following problems:

* It is fairly difficult to stay on track with expense or income tracking after the initial drive to do so burns out. It is a tedious process, especially if you have to do manual inputs. Now, imagine this process if you need to see the full picture across multiple people, bank accounts, credit cards, etc.
* There is a portion of the market that does not trust third-party apps enough to start and leave a fully live and authenticated connection between their various bank accounts and said third-party app.
* Many budget/expense trackers give us metrics or insights, but not in a way that contextualizes the insights to what is relatable and actionable for the user.

I want this app to be something that makes people realize their behavior when it comes to earning and spending money and understand that making changes is not an over-night process.

All that said, there will be some caveats to the MVP as I built this entirely using Python and Streamlit, with the intention of releasing this MVP and gathering feedback while I attempt to learn how to properly create a web-native app thru frameworks, such as TALL stack.

* Python and Streamlit don't have the flexibility to produce really aesthetically pleasing web apps, and it will show.
* Each action will cause the whole web app to recalculate, so it may seem that it's refreshing.
* Databases used are postgresql, firebase, and firestore.

Please let me know if you have any feedback and/or questions. I have enjoyed learning from everyone here.

I normally climb in the Scarpa Instinct women's line. e. I got them in my street size and I am 6 foot 3 and weigh 165lbs.

The TL;DR is I find them clunky and boot like, just like the older Solutions, except the Solutions feel a bit more precise and powerful. I really don't see the appeal of these shoes performance wise and am shocked this is considered a comp shoe. They would be a lot better with a split midsole and/or thinner toe rubber. I can see why people who just place the foot and don't really fine tune the foot position might enjoy em. Huge miss for me.

* EDIT: I figured out why I don't like the toebox. The 1 piece molded foot is the same thickness everywhere. A normal shoe has a thinner Rand, which puts the big toe closer to the wall/rock. When a normal shoe flexes the pieces move independently of one another. The Drone toe thickness pushes the toe back and when the flexes it doesn't flex as normal. It's sorta like a really thick no edge.

Good:

* Plush lining feels really soft and comfortable.
* Toebox stretches on the top knuckles.
* Despite being HV the overall shoe fits me well. The heel is weird coming from what I normally use, but mostly because of its thickness.
* Feel fairly powerful in the toe box.
* Easy to get into.
* Rubber is sticky, but most top end rubbers are pretty good so it's not a leg up over any other brand. I think when climbers claim one is better than the other its usually that the shoe fits/works for them more than the rubber itself.
* Cost: I got these for pretty cheap on sale online and they are way more premium than UP, for example.

Bad:

* I haven't enjoyed climbing in this shoe so far, so maybe a long break in?
* EDIT: I figured out why I don't like the toebox. The 1 piece molded foot is the same thickness everywhere. A normal shoe has a thinner Rand, which puts the big toe closer to the wall/rock. When a normal shoe flexes the pieces move independently of one another. The Drone toe thickness pushes the toe back and when the flexes it doesn't flex as normal. It's sorta like a really thick no edge.
* The molded forefoot to me is a big miss. The rubber on the toe hook area is extensive, but super thick and you can't really bend your foot or feel the hook as easily. The smearing is meager especially for a comp shoe. It is a bit more sensitive after using a bit, but less so than my Instinct Lace.
* Going off of that the mid foot is way too stiff. I like shoes with fairly stiff forefoot areas, but even the Instinct Lace doesn't have a full length sole. The result is the the toe gives a lot of support, but you can really articulate and flex your foot to get power down. The Drone feels like a big crowbar rather than a precision tool. I think if they had a split sole it would be much better. Most modern performance shoes seem to have a semi stiff to stiff forefoot and split midsole and that would be an improvement on these.
* The heel isn't bad, but to me feels heinously clunky and thick. I haven't seen an advantage of the spine and can see some very limited situations where it could be nice, but a softer heel can deform to the same edges just as well if you know how to use it. So, its me saying that its not a bad thing, but I don't think its as amazing as people claim.
* While plush the shoe is really hot on my foot.
* Build quality was meh. There was tons of excess glue on the heel and the logos were flaking off the shoe. The tongue strap feels thin and cheap as does the elastic material that they use. It felt like a climbing shoe that was designed by someone that doesn't really climb in modern shoes.
* The weird mid top on the inside of the ankle seems unnecessary honestly.
* The whole shoe just feels bulky to me. Weight wise an Instinct VS is 250g and these were a full 100g heavier per shoe.  That weight isn't holding me down and there is a lot more heel rubber and thicker rubber, but it makes it feel like a clog rather than an extension of my foot. I dislike this about the Solution and Evolv Phantom I tried. Some may love it. The Instinct feels way more form fitting and still pretty robust. The toe hook patch is smaller and thinner, but I can flex my toes upward and really pull on the toe hook. The Drone is just too thick for that.

At the end of the day I might try them a bit more, but I am not seeing any real advantages for me. They fit nice, but feel incredibly clunky to climb in. I can't imagine the regular Drone 2.0. They had good intentions, but to me these miss the mark of what a true modern climbing shoe should be. While I don't love up, the new Flagship Comp I saw at the gym today is leagues above these in design, feel, and build. Mad Rock is relying on the lower cost and social media/podcast PR a lot and I feel if you're going to do a 2.0 it should improve the older shoe, but most people I know that have used both (and even like them) agree that the 1.0 was the best of the 3 shoes, CS 2nd, and the 2.0 was a huge miss.",False,False,climbingshoes,Mad Rock Drone CS Experience,0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/climbingshoes/comments/1dbeagx/mad_rock_drone_cs_experience/

Generally speaking the Analytics unit at my company has a lot of Analysts with MBAs, DS ""degrees"", etc who mostly do BI work, pretty complex SQL stuff, sometimes run A/B tests. It hit me last year that a lot of them were making kinda noob mistakes- not running power calculations, often not correctly interpreting basic regression or ANOVA results- things that aren't necessarily going to sink the ship but show a lack of basic knowledge.

What I have since come to find out is many of these same Analysts have a lot of ""tools"" that are essentially cloned Databricks notebooks that someone else clearly built, but do everything from create simple correlation matrices to fit various types of models for feature reduction and specific types of propensity scoring. I was impressed at first, but after asking some basic questions I checked the version history of the notebook and noticed 0 edits. Straight up copy/paste, which is kinda weird because most people typically do add cells and edit their code right? And no other files in their repos that they might have logically copied from.

I was on a project recently where we had an extremely fast turn around and some of the modeling we did ended up being transformational for our marketing strategy. One of these Analysts approached me about my code and frankly it needed some cleaning up so I said I would send the link in a few days.

My co worker came up to me and noted that this individual had a really impressive R notebook about (insert the exact thing I did). I asked for the link and sure enough it's my code that they copied from a public repository, but one that is not connected to any shared resources such as Databricks. You'd have to find my name in Git and then check each one of my repos to find the files as they're buried a few levels down in some WIP subfolders. This person had been advocating for ""their work"" and had gotten ample traction.

So I approached them and asked about the code. During the coding I specifically configured gridsearch to be super granular for tuning ETA due to the model I was using needing shallower tree depth. Like, if they had written the code they would know why this was done. I asked about ""why so much attention given to ETA tuning"" and they gave me some generic answer about ""setting the model defaults"". If you've ever used any R package for XG Boost you do not need to supply ETA values by default and definitely not in Caret. Huge red flag that they had no clue what a lot of the code actually did. I then asked if they noticed anything interesting comparing the Feature Importance to SHAP values (I had and had written about it in a doc). They said ""oh no they're the same"" and I asked to see and they hadn't run the code!

So I'm kinda annoyed at this point. I mention it to a Manager and they said this is quite common. People can just find repos, copy/paste code, and often if they have the dataset it will run. Many will sorta pad their ""projects"" skill set up to sell themselves as ICs and often times their non-technical Managers or co workers have absolutely no clue.

At this point I search this individuals repo and they have literally copy/pasted all of my code from GIT into separate notebooks. A lot of stuff that no one at the company has done (because it was me just being bored and trying out a new method or package for fun), but organized in folders like ""Time Series Projects"".

Has anyone dealt with this before? I don't know what recourse there really is since the company owns all of our code/IP. I've considered adding random comments into my files as sort of a signature, but those can be erased. I'm mostly concerned that a bunch of individuals are going around claiming skills they don't have and then making mistakes on implementation that go unnoticed but have large impact. In this specific case we were dealing with a severe data skew and a lot of what we did would be potentially harmful on normal, balanced datasets and the actual models would likely perform quite poorly. Since we work in silo'ed pockets with stakeholders there often wouldn't be anyone to call that out. I don't think anything I do is very revolutionary or unique, but this case does bother me significantly and really makes me reconsider a lot of the ""work"" I see certain people involved in that others have observed copy/pasting work and pretending to have deeper knowledge. They still perform well on the work they have real skills at and I don't want people to get fired, but more of a ""stay in your lane"" for lack of a better term.",False,False,datascience,Imposter Colleagues Taking My Work,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cpupl2/imposter_colleagues_taking_my_work/

**Non-Technical Specifications:**

The router is in the living room, I am one room over with a kitchen between.

My girlfriend sits next to me (\\\~6 feet closer to the router) and her computer does not have these ping spikes it seems.

&#x200B;

**Attempted solutions:**

In the windows command line I ran netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=no wireless=""Wi-Fi 3"" (syntax might be slightly off but point is I disabled it).

Switch to 2.4 internet. Reduced the magnitude of the latency spikes from 4000 ms => 600 ms or so but did not noticeably change the frequency of events.

According to windows update all drivers are upto date.

Ran wlan optimizer to shut down background checks for available networks.

Checked whether or not any other application was trying to sync or use network resources. I think I eliminated any running programs but I am not sure.

I've now tried vista anti-lag to no avail.

Changing the orientation of my router changed the frequency of the ping spikes from consistent (every 15 seconds) to inconsistent every 15 seconds to as much as \~15 minutes.

**Question:**

Can anyone assist in helping me diagnose the nature of this ping spike? I can happily provide any needed information.

An employee has given their two weeks notice. Unexpectedly, six days in to their last two weeks the company tells the employee they are being terminated early. The employee has the following items from the company: a truck and uniforms (which are rented from a uniform servicing company). The truck is returned immediately, the uniforms are not returned as the employee does not have them. The company gives the employee a check for their work and expects them to return the uniforms on their own time.

Is the expectation of returning the uniforms on their own time legal?


Follow up comments: 

This took place in California. The employee is not an independent contractor. 

The employee attempted to return the uniforms the same day by having another company employee drop them off at home and take the uniforms as well as having the uber driver the company hired to take the employee home return the uniforms. 

This is relevant to the overall picture but I don't think it's relevant to the immediate question. The employee was told they are being let go early cause the company is slow. In the process of emailing the company about the uniforms the owner of the company informed the employee that they are actually being fired for not washing the company truck on their own time (without pay).

I'm currently working with a builder, and the base price for the construction (incl full unfinished 8ft basement), excluding land and land development costs, is $500K (~3700 sqft). Additional expenses for land and land development apply. The bare minimum included in this base price are outlined in the image below. Please note that appliances are not included, and the base cabinets, countertops, flooring, etc., are of the lowest quality.

My target budget for the entire build, encompassing everything from the upgrades, site work, septic system installation etc, is under $850K. Also recognize a buffer of up to an additional $50K to accommodate any unforeseen expenses.

Although I am relatively new to the world of construction, I aspire for this house to boast quality features comparable to those found in higher-end homes within the $1.2M+ price range. These homes typically valued at approximately $300-$350 per square foot in the township I'm building in with top schools.

I'm eager to receive any feedback or suggestions you may have, particularly regarding essential features. I've gleaned from this subreddit that additional outlets throughout the house, Cat6 wiring, conduits, etc., are indispensable considerations.

First thing first, the stock cables almost kill this iem, it's so uncomfortable and introduces noticeable noises with even the slightest head move. After replace the stock cable with Linsoul  Tripowin Amber, it becomes one of the most comfortable IEM I have tried. It's super small and light weight, so it can completely fit into my ear. I use the stock eartips, and found the seal is very good. It also gives a very good noise isolation and I can wear them in a busy street using median volume.

This thing is superior in bass and subbass  as many reviews have pointed out. It really delivers that punchy yet clean base for songs from DJ snake or Kim Petras. The sound is full of energy but not boomy. I also like classic music and I found the out of box tuning of IE 600 is not so great for orchestra music compare to my AKG n5005. The soundstage is significantly smaller and string music is not as excited.

However, the trick is to apply some heavy EQ. The one shown in the picture is based on the EQ preset from eqMac. The trick is increase 4khz and reduce 16khz. After this seemingly drastic EQ setting, the sennie house sound signature is definitely there. It even somehow reminds me HD800s sound.

Overall, I'm very happy about IE600 and no regrets getting it at $500. It is not a all arounder but pretty close if you are willing to apply EQ, at least for me.

I know the QC can be bad, so I bought it from a authorized dealer with 2 year warranty.

I'm working on a personal/school project to create day-ahead forecasts for a time series dataset of electricity consumption from different households in a state in the US (around 1000). So, I've got 1000 time series to forecast, and I'm trying to develop methods that can give accurate predictions for all of them.



Here's what I've tried so far:

1. \*\*Moving Average\*\*: Using the moving average of the last 7 days to forecast the next day.

2. \*\*LightGBM Model\*\*: Extracted datetime features (hour, day of the week, day of the month) and historical features (lag 1 day, lag 1 week, moving average of 7 days) from the datetime and the original time series. Then I fit a default LightGBM regressor and made predictions.



But, the moving average is still the best model in terms of mean MAPE over all households in the test set. From analyzing the moving average MAPE and visualizing some time series, I see that only 20-30% are very repetitive, while most fluctuate a lot, making them hard to predict. I also tried SARIMA, but it takes way too long to train a single model, let alone 1000 models and backtest them.



I think there must be some approaches that can beat this simple moving average method, but I'm stuck right now. So I'm looking for advice on how to tackle this problem in a good and standard way as the industry does.



How do companies usually handle large-scale forecasting like this? Do they use a single model for all the time series, or develop specific models for each one? If they have a model for each time series, how do they manage all the models (retraining, deploying, monitoring, etc.) at such a large scale?



I've tried searching online and using ChatGPT, but haven't found much on how to tackle this large-scale multiple time series problem. I'm also interested in MLOps and MLE, so I'm trying to approach this in a deeper way and learn how to do it properly.

I was thinking about a problem my girlfriend had, she had an upcoming test, that contained 45 questions, she was given 10 of those questions. And she only knows 10 answers, and for the sake of argument, she would be satisfied with having only 4 correct, so what is the probability of that?

So my thinking at first was that, the probability of the 1. question being known is 10/45=22%, the second 9/45=20.5%, third 18.6%, and fourth 7/42=16.7% and the total probability is product of these probabilities, so 0.14%. 

But the problem is, what if she knows the last 4 not the first 4, then the probability is 0.26%, and then it occurred to me, that there are quit a lot of possible combinations of which questions are known, because the order/rank of which questions she knows is not important.

For context I’ve done 8 yeas of EDC Vegas and other medium-size events so I’m very used to large festivals. 

Lodging 2/5

Dreamville - I got the easy tent package with global journey because otherwise it’s impossible to get tickets. This was the most miserable experience ever. Sure there’s all the this stuff to do but none of it matters if you can’t get good sleep and the heat is over you for the entire day with no AC. The amenities (air mattress, pillow, sleeping bag) were all so lackluster. I imagine if you’re local and drive over with all your camping gear it makes more sense. 

Saturday morning, I booked a hotel in Brussels and left the campsite. Best decision ever. I had some Belgian fries with ice cold Belgian beer in an AC’ed hotel lobby. I also got to walk around Brussels and checked out the city.

I highly recommend hotel over camping for international travelers. 

Transportation 5/5

To Festival: Getting from hotel to festival was a 60 euros 40 min Uber ride and a 30 min walk. Very doable when you’re well rested. No traffic getting in. 

Leaving festival - paid shuttle was 25 euros and 30 min of walking depending on where you are in the festival. Also great because you have a hot shower and bed and don’t have to worry about flagging down a taxi. 

Festival Grounds 3/5

The stages were much smaller than I expected compared to all the videos I’ve watched over the years. It was difficult to find space. Bathrooms were hard to locate and overall layout of the festival is a bit odd. Having to get into long lines to buy water was also not ideal. There was very little shade area to dodge the heat. 

Music 5/5

Im a boomer when it comes to EDM so the music was really up my alley. The sound system was also the best system I’ve heard at any festivals. Everything thing was crisp and clear. 3AL was even more trash than I expected but I knew that that coming in and just left after 5 min. Too bad garrix can’t close but he’s probably to expensive to book now.

I created a dockerfile like below:

Here is the setup on Python 3.10

* Installing cx\_Oracle (pip install cx-Oracle)
* Leaving the instant\_client\_folder on the desktop and using init\_oracle\_client to read it
* Also added LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (windows PC so maybe this is wrong, we'll try just using PATH) to the user environment variables with the path to this folder.

Code - This is the same code I use on my machine with no issues (using Python 3.11 but also previously 3.10)

    import oracledb
    import polars as pl

We've tried the following troubleshooting steps:

* Re-downloaded VS 2013 redistributable
* Re-download the instant client files (double checking 64-bit)
   * All instructions talk about 'installing' this but I just add it to my desktop, is there some other step required?
* Update the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (we'll try using just PATH instead)
* Ditch cx\_Oracle for Oracledb (but it needs to run in thick mode for us due to DB settings) so instead of `cx_Oracle.init_oracle_client` we use `oracledb.init_oracle_client` which I tested on my machine with no problems.

I see a number of posts which show a blatant misunderstanding of the way the US higher education system works. In particular, people seem to think that only rich students go abroad for undergrad but meritorious students go for masters. This is the complete opposite of reality: master's degrees in the US are complete cash cows and are uncapped in terms of international enrollment. Most of these degrees serve to implicitly transfer capital from unwary international students to domestic students / phd students.

Undergraduate degrees, especially at elite private schools , are highly selective since they usually cap international enrollment to around 10%. Moreoever, most such schools provide generous financial aid based on need unlike cash-cow master's programs. I paid 2000 USD a year for everything (including living expenses) for my undergraduate degree; a master's degree from the same institution in most fields would require you to sell your kidney. 

Everyone knows these master's degree mills are useless, which is why no one bats an eye if someone goes to Harvard for a master's (dime a dozen idiots get in) but Harvard College (the undergraduate school) only admits the very best Indians.  

PhD degrees are also very selective -- since they are funded -- as are medical and law degrees, but Indians typically don't do law (and are usually not eligible for US med school).

I am also from India although I did my undergrad in the US.

A lot of Indians seem to be posting here asking about MPP programs at brand name schools. I want to just let you know that an MPP is unlike an MBA or a tech degree and is unlikely to yield a US job that pays well enough to justify the debt you will likely have to take on to attend. You should only do one if you are ready to do relatively low paid work and even relocate back to India without any US experience outside of maybe RA gigs with professors.

The issue is most policy jobs in the US value communication skills and domain experience; as such, Indians have no comparative or absolute advantage over their American classmates, many of whom have valuable US policy experience before they enroll in an MPP (in fact, only those with valuable experience gain the most out of an MPP, not fresh grads, but this is a different point).

The only place where Indians \*may\* have an advantage is in quant oriented roles or research roles. MPPs are not good training for such roles and they usually require an econ phd. You also cannot usually get into an econ phd with MPP training. You need the equivalent of a US math major, along with substantial research experience, to even have a shot at most decent programs. In India the only program that provides this training is the ISI MSQE.

The good news is econ phd programs are incredibly effective at placing their students into good jobs, partly because the academic job market in economics is very healthy, and lots of industry and policy roles explicitly look for phd economists.

It’s a classic case of natural selection: if a trait is detrimental, it either adapts or vanishes over successive generations, potentially leading to extinction or significant change.  
  
However, we've arrived at a point where our intelligence has allowed us to meddle with the very principles of survival that shaped us. Most of our behaviors are rooted in our evolutionary past. For example, early humans needed social groups for hunting and protection, and emotions played a crucial role in maintaining these social bonds. Despite these behaviors being less relevant today, they've persisted because they didn't present a significant disadvantage strong enough to be phased out by natural selection.

But here’s the kicker: we've taken it a step further. Modern medicine, while life-saving, has also allowed us to preserve genes that might otherwise have been eliminated through natural processes. We treat and prolong the lives of individuals with genetic disorders, enabling them to reproduce and pass on those genes, possibly even with more severe mutations over generations.

So, doesn't this make us one of the least efficient species per capita in terms of genetic robustness? No other species in the animal kingdom has such a significant proportion of individuals with compromised genes actively contributing to the gene pool.

I really don't know the total AUM of the community, but collectively you guys provide $MMs worth of information. I hope I'll give it back someday.

I'm running a deep-tech B2B SaaS AI business based in the US. Not a ChatGPT wrapper, something genuinely innovative and technical. Initially, I was a solo founder with technical expertise but zero business background. A VC helped me out for 3-4 months with mentorship, pitch deck feedback, etc.

We now have a fully functional MVP and are entering pilot programs. When it came time for the term sheet:

* They offered $100k for a $1M valuation.
* I countered with at least $1M for a $10M valuation.

Here's their counter:

* ""You're a solo founder with no business experience and no exits. This is the best you'll get.""

Before going to other VCs, I took that advice. Because I also thought that this was necessary. So, I brought on another co-founder for the business side and gave him 30% equity. He really helped me and did not take any money. So I am okay for giving that equity. Then I recruited two PhDs to help us. They are advisors. Now I'm not alone. New term sheet:

* Still $100k for a $1M valuation.
* ""You gave away too much equity. You're too diluted and lack motivation.""

Honestly, I was pissed. The argument lasted for hours. I need your insights because I'm inexperienced. Here's their reasoning:

1. **Pre-revenue startups don't get better deals:** ""You should at least have $1M ARR.""
2. **No successful exits:** ""Without exiting 10 businesses, you won't get a high valuation.""
3. **Technical founder bias:** ""You're all technical; you should just be a CTO."" They flat-out said that if I get to Series A, either they or another VC will make me a CTO, not a CEO.
4. **Superstar requirement:** ""You can only get a $10M valuation at PreSeed/Seed if you're a superstar.""

From what I’ve read and experienced, this doesn't seem right. Their argument is, “We've been doing this for 20 years. Trust us.” But it sounds more like I'm being gaslighted.

* I bootstrapped the business for 12 months, didn't receive a single dollar payment. Now I have the MVP and we'll be selling in a month.
* In the meantime, I hired and fired 3 engineers. They were good. But they weren't working enough for a start-up. Ended up building the entire product from top to bottom myself (really at the end of the day their contribution is 0 lines of code. What a waste).
* I have this friend. He's a web dev, which isn't our core business, but we also require a web dev since we're related to web. He doesn't know the core business, neither is he really good at web dev. But the point is I really do trust the guy. I've known him for years. And I know for a fact that he'd try his best, whether his best would be technically enough is a question mark.

A rational agent is a concept in decision theory and economics that refers to an entity which always chooses the optimal action to achieve its goals, based solely on logic and available information, without being influenced by emotions or ethical considerations. At first, Claude expressed concerns about ethics. I repeatedly instructed it not to be emotional and to tell me how to win in business without considering human emotions.

I'm managing a DS/ML team in my company, and we've been picking up a couple of projects that uses LLM.

To date, I see that for the applications happening inside the company, using LLM APIs (OpenAI, Google, etc) and building systems around it (RAG, guardrails, prompting, you name it) is still the way to go because of:

- Speed to iterate

- Fine-tuning data not readily available

- The current + foreseeable future use cases seems to be able to be solved using ""general knowledge"" contained in the big tech's pretraining + instruct-tuning

I still see fine-tuning being thrown around by either the big tech sales people (I get it, they're sales function at the end of the day) or by senior leadership that knows a bit into the details behind these LLMs, but personally I don't see a specific value yet of doing fine-tuning at my company's scale.



The reasons I can think of on why someone in my position resorts to fine tuning is:

- If there is an available infrastructure + team managing it already, and serving our own fine-tuned model is cheaper (economy of scale).

- Compliance issues (eg. maybe Banks really don't want to risk their data being sent to other company's server)

- Risk of the model's response stability being at the hand of the provider

- If the task is proven to be too specific, and even GPT-4/Opus/Gemini-1.5 with RAG, etc can't solve (or the modifications around it becoming too expensive)



Based on your experience, is there a major reason that I miss? Another recent data point is Cognition labs. If people at their caliber wrap their system around GPT-4, why should I bother with fine-tuning?

She should have the identity of an in-your face melee AD damage caster/brawler, relying on passive stack management for strength. Basically shifting to being a consistent bully instead of a champ who can only fight during the power spike from her ultimate.

- Add small amount of black cleaver-like armor shred to passive stacks, applied to enemy after autoing
- Increase passive damage scaling
- Make q3 go through CC after cast (similar to Jax w, Xin w, Aatrox q, etc.)
- Reduce passive stack limit down to 2
- Reduce bonus AD and scaling on R

The armor shred opens up more early game item options when the opponent rushes armor and makes her suffer less into tabis rush. The shred doesn't need to be that much, just enough to help the lane feel less toxic. If the opposing team stacks a lot more armor, additional shred would still be built to complement the passive shred.

The q through CC is meant to reduce punishment for getting hit during her rather long q3 animation. For example, a Gragas can react to and cancel Riven's q3 altogether with a single body slam, effectively punishing her unreasonably hard for trying to use it. Why? She gets punished for the time extra time spent in the animation for the ability that did nothing (self CC?), for the opponent's CC duration on top of that, and for the instant retaliation from AA or abilities that the opponent can do during the CC now that the Q3 brought her into melee range. Other aforementioned abilities by other champions go off regardless of CC so this would modernize her kit to be in line with that of others.

To clarify, the stack limit of 2 nerf would make it so the player has to choose between extended trade damage and burst on combos like ER-Q vs ER-A-Q. For example ER-WQ-AQ-ARQ would burst a single opponent much faster but loses extended trade damage since 3 passive stacks would be lost compared to ER-AW-AQ-AQ-AR. If properly balanced/compensated for the nerf with the other changes, this could add an extra dynamic to how Riven is played. This could mean opting for faster or slower combos based on enemy HP or other factors like jungle ganks.

I agree with not pulling but the unit itself is a lot better than what is being discussed.

What I don't hear being a part of the conversation are the following: 
(1) additional automatic actions outside their own turn
(2) creation of a field with a lasting effect
(3) buff removal from enemies

I will not make a case to pull any old units unless you really like them or they have unique gameplay aspects to your teams since there is some power creep in the game. But if you pulled for him or have him, for the reasons above, you will be happy with the consistency and long term value he will provide to your account. For the same reasons, I would argue Luocha will likely be slightly better to have long term than Huohuo.

Let me elaborate:

Examples of (1) so far are mostly follow up attacks like Ratio, Blade, and Clara. You can also count Fu's table flip healing, and from what I could tell, maybe Aventurine's automatic shield reapplication. Having these mechanics adds consistency to the gameplay that units who are turn locked do not. Units who have this will find a longer term niche for themselves in the meta. Note that a lot of harmony units have mechanics which make your strong units act more consistently which is part of why many of them are so strong.

Examples of (2) are Fu's damage reduction field, Ruan Mei's res pen field, and Luocha's healing field. These all apply continuous buffs across multiple turns, adding team-wide continuous value. This is opposed to single turn (one-and-done) effects that don't interact with the team like HuoHuo skill healing.

As far as I know (3) is fairly unique to Luocha at the moment but will have increased value as hoyo adds buff mechanics to enemies in order to make content harder.

Ultimately, you should pull who you like but if you want to decide which units to pull from an account value perspective in general, you should look for: mechanics which evolve over time as teammates get stronger (interaction with teammates) > gameplay consistency mechanics > raw DPS.

The only actual reasons I see not to pull are power creep, Aventurine seeming a better option if you need sustain, Acheron <3 likely also getting better over time with her unique ult stacking, other cool Penacony characters.

A carteira de crédito somou 48 bilhões de reais, alta de 24,9%, puxada pelas carteiras de crédito com garantia, como consignado e financiamento de veículos. Em junho, o consignado respondia por 48% da carteira, seguido por financiamento de veículos (23%) e créditos a pessoas físicas (20%).

Katz afirmou que a expectativa é que a carteira de crédito continue crescendo, com o banco terminando o ano com um portfólio em torno de 60 bilhões de reais.

1. The barrel is 24 inches, much longer than a stock 10/22. I'm over 6 ft and this is a great size and light enough that it doesn't need a sling. The added length makes it easier to use irons and keeps the noise down.
2. Speaking of noise: without a suppressor, CCI subsonic suppressor .22 lr reads 110 Db at my ear; well within hearing safe for several shots over the course of a day. Regardless of the reading it ""feels"" quite. Threads are available if you want it really quite.
3. It's a good looking, great feeling, solid rifle. The lever action ensures subsonic rounds will cycle and the quarter cock safety make it easy to carry with one in the chamber.

Be aware that the rifle does not come with swivels for a strap and only has a 10 lr round capacity. 

The main contender was a 10/22.

Our market was competitive before the pandemic and being generally picky people we never ended up buying anything. I've been scrolling through this sub for the previous hour and feel compelled to share.

Investing is easy, trading is hard. A recent post shared a red line with housing prices bouncing from it. Notice that the peak of 2008 is lower than much of the 20-teens. In general buying stuff like equities and houses is a good deal if you don't have a sell date in mind. If you can ride the train until it stops somewhere nice, get on. That said, houses are not equal like the shares of the SPY; you have to live in them. A point missed by many claiming that the previous two years was the right time to buy overlook the many compromises in quality, likability, and affordability that had to be sacrificed to get some ""shares"". These compromises have not been reflected in the price.

Timing by how much, and when, prices will move up or down, is the hardest game on the planet. This is by virtue of how much money is at stake, and thus how much brain power is invested. None of the arguments for up or down I have read on this sub hold water. All of them could, but none of them have been justified by rigorous quantitative analysis. For those citing economists consider: these estimates are altered quarter by quarter; if they were prescient I expect the authors would rather enjoy the profits from trading than re-tweaking their models to fit new data.

This brings me to my final thought: this sub is pornography.

Thing is.. scala is pretty much not used by our industry. At prior shops they were either straight java / python or c# if they were Microsoft shop. I have yet to find a shop that embraced scala. I love the live execution debugger, such a nice feature. Feels like pdb.

I spend a lot of time on /r/fermentation and I've noticed that many posts there are along the lines of ""I made this thing, is it infected?"" Most of the time, it's perfectly fine. The real dangerous stuff, like mold, is usually easy to spot. This got me thinking about creating an app that allows users to upload photos and get help in identifying obvious issues. 

my tensorflow fu is weak but my data engineer skills are strong. anyone interested in partnering up in putting this together?  what i need from you:

\- Assistance with the TensorFlow (or alternative) model. My preference is to use Python for the web layer.

\- Help in collecting input and validation data. I have come across a few smaller datasets, but I'm not sure if they are extensive enough for training and validating the model.

&#x200B;

Here's what I'll bring to the project:

\- I'll take the TensorFlow model and build a Streamlit app on top of it.

\- The app layer will have a FastAPI backend endpoint.

\- I'll cover all infrastructural or hosting costs.

\- The app will be hosted on Kubernetes (K8s) and available over SSL through Nginx.

\- Any changes committed to GitHub will be deployed through ArgoCD.

&#x200B;

Please note that this is a hobby project and it will never be a paid service. I'm not doing this to enhance my resume; I simply think it's a cool idea that can be (relatively) easily achieved.

&#x200B;

Here are the common contaminants I'd like to identify. The really harmful ones have bright colors that contrast nicely:

&#x200B;

\- Mold: Any mold growth should be considered potentially harmful.

   1. Penicillium: This mold can appear as blue or green patches on the surface of sauerkraut.

   2. Cladosporium: This mold typically appears as black or brown spots.

   3. Aspergillus: This mold can appear in various colors such as green, black, or gray.

   4. Mucor: This mold may show as white or gray fuzzy patches on the surface.

&#x200B;

\- Yeast: Yeast is not typically considered harmful, but it can lead to off flavors.

   1. Kahm yeast is a type of wild yeast . not dangerous but off tasting. It appears as a white or cream-colored film on the surface and can sometimes develop in areas where the brine is exposed to air.

&#x200B;

here is a paper that seems to think its totally feasible with decent accuracy

I’ve looked into nzxt fish tank cases and lian li ones as well. Those look great and seem sufficient to cool my system enough from it to crash.

Mostly for traveling (e.g. using it on a train) and so on, preferably with qmk support, and support for easily switching between multiple devices (like the logitech keyboards. No clue if that's in qmk anyways or how hard that would be to do myself). Preferably no cords between the two halves needed.

Mostly nice-to-haves:

No strong preference for either hot-swapability or low-profile switches. Somewhat prefer open-source pcbs so I could do small layout changes (or add hot-swap support, etc). Don't really mind printing the pcb on my own, but simply buying one with the chips soldered already would be nice. No backlight of any kind needed(/wanted).

Anyone got a great recommendation? I realize I am asking for quite a lot.

Just throwing a blue micro on an iris seems like it might cause a lot of headaches and rewrites of larg-ish parts of the qmk-integration(?).

Is my intuition just wrong? Does anybody have facts to back her 'science' up?

She also mentions that is the reason Venus is not tidally locked. Again, does somebody know of papers that backs this up? I could not find anything.

------

Reality TV often presents a distorted portrayal of individuals, leading viewers to misjudge them in several ways. Firstly, editing plays a significant role in shaping characters, as producers condense hours of footage into concise storylines, often emphasizing conflict and drama over reality. This editing can exaggerate certain traits or actions, portraying participants in a sensationalized light.

Moreover, participants are often encouraged to adopt particular personas or behaviors to fit predetermined roles within the show's narrative. This pressure to perform can lead to exaggerated or inauthentic representations of themselves, further skewing viewers' perceptions.

Additionally, the competitive nature of reality TV incentivizes strategic gameplay and manipulation. Contestants may engage in tactics designed to gain favor with audiences or undermine competitors, leading to behaviors that viewers might misinterpret or judge harshly without considering the context of the game.

Furthermore, viewers often lack insight into the personal backgrounds and motivations of participants, leading to snap judgments based solely on edited footage. This lack of context can perpetuate stereotypes or reinforce negative perceptions.

Overall, the constructed nature of reality TV, coupled with editing choices, participant performances, and the competitive environment, creates ample opportunities for misjudgment. Viewers should approach reality TV with a critical eye, recognizing that what they see on screen may not always reflect reality accurately.",False,False,90dayfianceuncensored,This subreddit is an awful judge of character and relationships : Sam and Citra Edition,0.24,https://www.reddit.com/r/90dayfianceuncensored/comments/1b0df4m/this_subreddit_is_an_awful_judge_of_character_and/

Lots of good memories, and I just find it yummy (unlike many on here, it seems). The oak and corn notes really do it for me, so take that for what you will. This has predisposed me to approaching other Brown-Forman bourbons with a generally positive outlook.
Two months ago I got the Old Forester Single Barrel as part of my quarterly D&M American whiskey club shipment, and I've been steadily sipping it ever since. My general opinion of it has been that I love the nose, but the taste leaves a bit to be desired. I just bought the Old Forester 86 -- having never tried it -- so I felt it appropriate to do a side-by-side.    
  
  
**Prep**: Both neat in Glencairns. Let sit for 20 minutes. The 86 was just opened, whereas the SiB has been open for a few months, and was half empty when I did the tasting.  
   
    
**Color**: Identical shade of golden brown (sorry, forgot to get a picture).    
    
  
**Nose**:   
   
- **86**: Heavy, Woodford-esque wood notes with vanilla, baking spices, and a hint of hickory smoke. Surprising amount of depth. Really nice.    
- **SiB**: Very similar, with a bit more of a wild, nutty quality to it. Likely a result of a higher proof and being a single barrel. I love this nose, but am pleasantly surprised (for my wallet's sake) that the 86 holds it own in this regard: The SiB's nose isn't that much better.
 
**Palate**:  
  
- **86**: Marshmallows (?!), bananas, bubble gum, woodiness, BBQ chips. Light and very pleasant.
- **SiB**: Silky mouthfeel. Heaver and woodier with the higher proof. None of the fruity lightness of the 86. Disappointing.
 
 
**Finish**:  
  
- **86**: With the low proof, its not surprising that the finish is fast and unremarkable. It doesn't necessarily detract from the bourbon overall though. Nevertheless, the finish is nothing of note.
- **SiB**: The wood notes linger. Longer finish than the 86, but not terrible remarkable.
 
 
**Overall**:  
  
- **86**: **B+**. For the value this is simply a great bourbon. Even with Washington's onerous liquor taxes, I think I paid less than $25. The nose is pleasant with a decent depth and complexity, and unlike the SiB, the taste keeps pace with the nose. This could be my new favorite cheap-ish bourbon. Next up is to get my hands on the signature 100.
- **SiB**: **B**. After trying the 86, I'm even more disappointed at the disparity between this bourbon's nose and taste. Maybe its just this barrel in particular, but I would choose the 86 over this. This one is also quite a bit more expensive and less widely-available.
 
 
**Takeaway**:  
  
If you like woodier bourbons, particularly Woodford, then the Old Forester 86 is a great daily sipper. Its cheap, sufficiently multidimensional, and widely-available.

Here's what's happened this season so far. The decks I used the most are [Boros (without Errant Knight)](https://mtga.untapped.gg/profile/fdb6b8f3-1470-48de-b529-f4e7cbadf417/TTV7XE3SZFCLBHXQQTC5L4UC6M/deck/df643174-dca2-4a45-8a86-e1fe26caaa9a?gameType=constructed&constructedType=ranked) and a [mono-black (Obliterator)](https://mtga.untapped.gg/profile/fdb6b8f3-1470-48de-b529-f4e7cbadf417/TTV7XE3SZFCLBHXQQTC5L4UC6M/deck/6be7c34b-8687-4df6-9647-73d35a235958?gameType=constructed&constructedType=ranked). 

So far, the general experience in ranked is pretty miserable from the time investment perspective. Here are some takes: 

1. It takes upwards of 200 matches from Platinum to Diamond, i.e. 24 (6 x 4) wins (W) lead over losses (L). So that is W = L+24; and W + L > 200. Honestly, the MMR striving for an overfit makes for a miserable experience.
2. Decks usually perform much better when they're newly brewed for your account. Then, it goes back to the W = L ratio.
3. If I'm playing mono-black, I mainly face some version of three decks - mono-black (mirror), mono-red, and golgari control. If I'm playing boros, I mainly face Azorious control, and mono-red. 
4. My benchmark for taking the deck to the ranked is that it produces a win rate of >70% over 15-20 games. Obliterator in its first iteration gave me 13-3 in unranked and 41-28 initially and then, 70-64 (this season). Boros in its first iteration gave me 11-4 in unranked and 26-12 initially and then, 26-15 (this season). 

Aggro appears to be the only sane way to rank up for me, is this common knowledge? Anyways, because ranking takes up so much time, I will probably switch to just going up to Platinum and enjoying my brews in the unranked. The rewards are not worth the time investment. One can keep spamming mono-red in ranked but that doesn't sound fun. 

Anyways, this is my experience with standard ranked. I would love to see if this is the experience with everyone else.

WOE has done fat load of nothing. 

I was really excited about this set before it came out. This set is as bad as BRO. That set was awful.

1. Match making has been terrible since the set came out. Win rate sucks and doing dailies has been painful. All I need to do is attack with 25 creatures and I keep getting matched with people who have removal or board wipe every turn. The removal is so painfully cheap in the previous sets and they really needed to rotate it out. While there are some decent creatures, getting them to stick for more than a turn feels next to impossible. I think I'll go back to my non-creature decks. 


2. The creatures themselves are pretty expensive. Yes, four mana creature is expensive, especially if it's not green. It doesn't seem to matter what their abilities are. They are immediate targets. Try getting a Rowan, Will, Eriette to stick - painful.


3. The games continue to be long and drab. I thought battles in MOM would slow the game down, oh geez, the role mechanic sucks way more. Sorcerer role with Ward 1 is useless. 


4. WU archetype of tapping is very expensive to be able to keep up with so cheap removal. Who ever thought of that should be fired. Tapping a creature often costs 3 mana, removal is 2. Why would anyone even build a deck when you're not even going to be able to use the mechanic. 


5. The set isn't very playable with its own cards. Faeries are not that good either. They are so small that a 3 mana Path of Peril or Temporary lockdown will wipe the board off all faeries. At least mono red has haste so you deal some hits and you don't need creatures for dealing damage straight to life total; but there's nothing for this. Only thing they do have going is that they're flyers, that's it. There isn't even a way to buff them on the spot. Hell, I'll take a creature in BU that buffs other faeries.


6. There's exactly one planeswalker and it can't even stand on it's own. It requires a million other cards to get a win con out of it. Plenty of opportunity for pretty much any color other than blue to kill it with cheap spot removal. 


7. It is perhaps a good drafting set. But I don't see how you can get them to work in the current standard. It kind of works in Alchemy because all that cheap removal trash rotated out.
 

So what's your experience with the WOE so far. I had high expectations but it kinda sucks for me so far. At best it's a draft set.

>*1 John 4:16 -  And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.*

>*1 John 4:17 -  Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.*

>*1 John 4:18 -  There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.*

>*1 John 4:19 -  We love him, because he first loved us.*

>*1 John 4:20 -  If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?*

>*1 John 4:21 -  And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.*

This is very difficult commandment for sure but do you see what GOD wants us to do? He wants us to spread the love that He had. Full of challenges and hatred from people makes it harder to love but still, we ought to hold our ground and spread love. This never goes in vain and our Lord Jesus shall reward us according to our endurance and work.

June: car title still had not been delivered. I'm moving, so I file a change of address request online and resign myself to having to travel back to FL to sell my car at a later date.

July 8: Still no title, so I ask the leasing office for my old apartment building to check if the title is in my old mailbox, and it is! It must've been delivered just before my change of address and mail forwarding request took effect. They open it up, send a picture and put it back in my mailbox so I can pick it up before my lease ends in August.

July 15: I mail my mailbox key to a friend of mine so he can mail me the title. Instead, all he finds is a USPS change of address confirmation letter and a green note indicating to the mail carrier that the mailbox is vacant. The title is no longer there.

Does anyone know what could've happened to my title? Would USPS forward something that's already been delivered and opened but left in the mailbox? Would they bring it to the local post office?

I did my graduation in 2019 and just after it I worked as Python Developer/Data Engineer for 1.5 years but in Dec 2020 I decided to take UPSC exams and gave 2 attempts but couldn't make into it, though I cleared SSC but didn't join as the post I got was of D Grade.

I can't express in words how I felt but I hope you guys understand it.  
Then last year in Dec, on advice of my brother I decided to do a Post Graduation Certification in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to upskill and again kick start the career. I tried to do my best there and I even performed decent there, won 2 hackathon that are conducted by them but I still don't have that energy to fight, to hustle and I fell like I am just walking on a sprint track. I don't feel like to try hard outside my comfort zone, not doing things until and unless it's absolutely necessary to do. In my mind I know I have to get out of this zone and hustle more but my will doesn't allow me to do anything. Also with all the news of layoffs, hiring freeze make me more demotivated. I really don't understand how do I come out of this zone?

Also, is it possible to be back into IT after 3 years of straight away gap + 8 months of Post Graduation Bootcamp gap? Do companies consider it a red red flag? or do they allow people ?

I started out my career at Deloitte Consulting (back when it was called S&O, I think it's called something different now?) from 2014-2017. Since then, I made a series of job hops and went back to school to transition  to analytics / data science. I'm not going to get into the distinction between analytics and data science/machine learning here. Just know that I don't do any predictive modeling, and instead do primarily AB testing, causal inference, and dashboarding/reporting. 

I'm sharing my job transitions and schooling in case it helps anyone else who wants to get into analytics. I live in a HCOL area in the US. I went to a low-ranked state school and studied Marketing in undergrad.

  
**Progression from Deloitte Consulting to Data Analytics**

*  2014-2017 - Deloitte Consulting S&O
   * Role: Business Analyst, promoted to Consultant after 2 years
   * Pay: Started at a base salary of $73k no bonus, ended at $89k no bonus.
* 2017-2018: Non-FAANG tech company
   * Role:  Strategy Manager - I got tired of the travel and long hours for relatively low pay, so decided to switch jobs doing basically the same thing but at one company.
   * Pay: Base salary of $105k, 10% annual bonus. No equity
* 2018-2020: Small start-up (\~300 people)
   * Role: Data Analyst. At the previous non-FAANG tech company, I worked a lot with the data analytics team. I realized that I couldn't do my job as a ""Strategy Manager"" without the data team because without them, I couldn't get any data. At this point, I realized that I wanted to move into a data role.
   * Pay: Base salary of $100k. No bonus, paper money equity. Ended at $115k.
   * Other: To get this role, I studied SQL on the side. 
* 2020-2022: Mid-sized start-up in the logistics space (\~1000 people).
   * Role: Business Intelligence Analyst II. Work was done using mainly SQL and Tableau
   * Pay: Started at $100k base salary, ended at $150k through a series of one promotion to Data Scientist, Analytics and two ""market rate adjustments"". No bonus, paper equity.
   * Also during this time, I completed a part time masters degree in Data Science. However, for ""analytics data science"" roles, in hindsight, the masters was unnecessary. The masters degree focused heavily on machine learning, but analytics roles do very little ML.
* 2022-current: Large tech company, not FAANG but pays on par
   * Role: Sr. Analytics Data Scientist
   * Pay: Started at $210k base salary with annual RSUs worth $110k at the stock price at the time I joined. Total comp of $320k. Ended at $240k base salary, plus additional RSUs totaling to $270k per year at the stock price when I receive the raise. Total comp of $510k. Achieved through two raises and generous RSU grants.
   * I will mention that this comp is on the high end. I interviewed a bunch in 2022 and received 6 full-time offers for Sr. analytics roles and this was the second highest offer. The lowest was $185k base salary at a startup with paper equity. 

**Why I wanted to switch from Consulting to Analytics**  
I wanted a more technical and analytical job. I was tired of taking meeting notes, making PowerPoint decks, and managing project timelines that I had no control over. I pursued data analytics because the bar for coding and math is relatively low (you basically only need to know SQL, undergraduate statistics, and beginner/intermediate Python). Compared to Machine Learning roles, the bar for coding and math is much higher. However, I felt analytics roles were still analytical and technical enough for me, without being out of my reach like ML roles. And I actually didn't know this when I switched, but the pay is also way better than I imagined it would be. In tech, with the exception of Product management roles, analytics roles get paid more than most equivalent level post-MBA roles. The base salary might be similar but most tech companies consider analytics roles to be tech, and tech roles get a lot more equity than non-tech roles (e.g. Strategy and Operations Manager, Project Manager, Program Manager, etc.). At my current company, you'd probably have to be a Director or Sr. Director of a business (non-tech) role to make the same as a Sr. Analytics role.

  
**How to switch from Consulting to Analytics**

I do think that consultants (should) have all of the soft skills in terms of story telling and stakeholder management. These skills are what set me apart from other data scientists who have PhDs but don't know how to talk to business people. What consultants will lack are likely the following:

* SQL. Guaranteed you will have to pass a SQL screen in the interview process.
* Undergraduate statistics. You can learn this by just doing the Khan Academy statistics videos, which are free
* AB testing
* Data case interviews. You all are familiar with case interviews as consultants. Data case interviews are similar but obviously, focus more on data. [This article by Interviewquery](https://www.interviewquery.com/p/data-science-case-study-interview-questions#data-analytics-case-study-questions) provides a lot of free analytics case question examples, although it doesn’t provide sample answers. All of them are relevant for analytics  case interviews except the Modeling and Machine Learning section.

If anybody is interested in learning more about analytics, or wants to discuss how to make the switch, just DM me. I wrote up a guide on how to pass analytics interviews because a lot of my Data Science classmates had asked me for advice. I don't think the sub-rules allow me to link it though, so DM me and I'll send it to you.

If they receive 0 grams then their experience is the same as the control group. The majority of the people in the treatment group (\~90%) received more than 0 grams of the supplement. Let's assume that if the treatment group receives the supplement, that they ingest it. The control group does not receive the supplement at all. The outcome variable we are interested is amount of weight lost.

I could do a regression like Y\~Treatment\_Group where Y represents the amount of weight lost, and Treatment\_Group is a binary variable that has a value of 1 if the person is the treatment and 0 if the person is in the control. This would give me an estimate of the effect of being in the treatment group.

My question is, how could I structure the regression if I wanted to estimate the effect of the amount of supplement received? For example, I want to answer the question ""does taking more of the supplement lead to greater weight loss?"". I have information on the amount of supplement a control person would have received had they been in the treatment group. I was thinking to structure the regression like this and include an interaction variable:

Y\~Treatment\_Group + Supplement\_Amount + Treatment\_Group\*Supplement\_Amount, where Y and Treatment\_Group are the same as above. Supplement\_Amount represents the amount of the supplement that the person received if they were in the treatment group. If the person was in the control group, this variable represents the amount of supplement they would have received if they were in the treatment group.

Long time data science professional (nearing age 40 and been at it since the early 2010’s), graduated in the late 2000’s from college with a degree in mathematics. I’m mostly self trained on the technical aspects of the job, which does play a part in my ambitions.

Cons are that I have to take a foundational programming course (which is a nice GPA boost, but really seems wasteful, given my background) and that it’s more of an MIS program than a CS program, which makes me worried that I’ll invest the time and money into it only to be outcompeted by people who have the harder degree.

Two days ago, car wouldn’t start at all. I had it towed to dealer who again said P0335, but then quoted me for a “Bulkhead harness and engine harness replacement” repair at $5755. When I called to talk them about a sensor vs a wiring harness, they said “well, the sensor tests fine, there are two bent pins in the wiring harness, and the diagnostic manual says we have to replace it.”

Some questions:

1. Holy crap. This isn’t cheap! Is it really warranted? Should I find a different shop? (I’ve been going to the same dealer for a while and they’re one of the cheaper places in town.) 20 hours is the quoted labor (at $175/hr) and the part is $1600ish. 

1a. Can the pins be straightened? What would cause “bent pins” in a harness? Will this repair last another 120k miles?

2. Is this the start of a suite of electrical issues I’ll have to chase down? If I replace this harness, will there be more gremlins I’ll have to suffer over the next *N* years amd pay to chase down/fix?

3. Seems like KBB puts my car’s trade in (when functioning) at about the same cost as this repair. As much as I don’t want a new car note, should I consider trading in the car and looking for something else?",False,False,subaru,"2011 Outback, 119k miles, p0335 code, $5755 quote for wiring harness to repair",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/1bl7h52/2011_outback_119k_miles_p0335_code_5755_quote_for/

* Kernighan and Ritchie, *C Programming Language* (2nd Edition)

2. *Have you taken a course that covers computer architecture topics?

My situation is:

* $8,700 remaining on a commercially-held FFEL Stafford loan, unsubsidized and from my undergrad years. Navient is showing a negligible amount of interest that would capitalize. 6.8% interest rate. Not currently under payment freeze, but no payment due until May 2024.

* $6,900 remaining on a DOE-held FFEL Stafford loan, unsubsidized and from my undergrad years. Nelnet is showing $0 accrued interest. 6.8% interest rate. Currently under payment freeze.

* Remainder of debt is a mix of direct loans, mostly for graduate school and mostly unsubsidized.

I was fortunate enough to be steadily employed through the pandemic, and knocked off all my private loans during the payment pause on federally held loans. I then started aggressively paying the FFELP loan, which is why the next payment due date is in May 2024.

My employment situation became more volatile in January, so I've temporarily stopped payment on the FFELP loan. I'd like to make sure I'm in a good spot to go on some form of IDR and not make payments if money is tight later in the year when the payment freeze presumably ends.

REPAYE looks like a solid option for me, I'm not eligible for PAYE. But the FFEL Stafford loans wouldn't be eligible unless I consolidated them. (If I knew the payment pause and interest freeze were going to last this long, I would have consolidated the privately held one in 2020. Whoops.)

Any thoughts, in particular regarding subtle pro/cons of consolidating either just the privately-held FFEL into a direct loan, or both of the FFEL loans into a direct loan? I owe more than $10k in direct loans, so they would be able to absorb the forgiveness if it survives SCOTUS, even if ""bundling"" my eligible federally-held FFEL loan with the ineligible privately held FFEL loan makes the former ineligible.

If you want to DPS a boss from up front, spamming your throwing hammer is dramatically more powerful, even without stacks of roaring flames, than a glaive can ever be.

I don't understand why bungie has such a grudge against close range playstyles in endagme content. I get that sitting in the back of the map in a rift with a scout rifle is what they want for pvp, but why does that have to be the only option in pve too?

Fuck me for liking glaives, I guess

Edit: I added this before but I guess it got lost when the thread was removed then reinstated then removed then reinstated again. The above is per-hit damage numbers, so I also tested swing/punch rates. With normal punches I was hitting every 0.97 seconds (29 frames in a 30 fps screen recording) and the glaive was hitting a three-hit combo every 1.65 seconds (55 frames). **That works out to the glaive doing 49% more DPS than just sitting there punching, when you have close to melee.** I'll let you decide if that means they're strong enough.

Edit 2: for everyone saying this lost sector boss isn't a valid place to test: do you think the buff provided by synthoceps is different against other targets? I was hitting the same numbers against ads in the same sector.

The Ikelos SMG is one of the best weapons in the game, and actually pretty easy to get if you know what to do.

# How to get the Ikelos SMG/Shotgun/Sniper/Hand Cannon v3

* Go to your consumables inventory and find the resonance amp
* Interact with it - it will consume four resonant stems, and update it's description to give you a hint to a location of a warmind node somewhere in the world. If you need resonant stems, they drop from Heist Battlegrounds.
* Head to that warmind node and interact with it. [This guide from polygon](https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23497351/season-seraph-warmind-node-locations-europa-moon-luna-resonate-stems-override-codes) has all the locations, with screenshots. It will give you one of the four Ikelos weapons, and they have a chance to be deepsights. The ones inside Operation Seraph Shield are guaranteed deepsights (1 for each weapon).

Edit: You can also get a couple of them from the Ikelos deepsight engram from the exo frame's reward track.

There are 16 total warmind nodes, 6 each on the moon and europa, and 4 in operation seraph shield. You can only get each one once. Collecting them all is required for one of the triumphs that's part of the seraph title (though you don't need all of the triumphs for the title, thanks /u/_General_Account_ for the correction). You can place them in the helm and they'll play music when you complete a set.

* Once you've collected all 16 nodes, the only way to get more drops of the Ikelos weapons is to focus engrams. The focus costs resonant stems, so it's always 4 resonant stems = 1 weapon. In my experience the limiting factor is usually umbrals, not stems.

**Warmind nodes, focusing engrams, and the deepsight engram on the exo frame's rewards track are the only ways to get these weapons.**",False,False,DestinyTheGame,"If the v3 Ikelos weapons haven't been dropping for you all season, you're not unlucky - you need to use the resonance amp in your consumables inventory",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/117g0nr/if_the_v3_ikelos_weapons_havent_been_dropping_for/

This is the only content leaving the game at that point, so it's the thing to focus on right now. You can still buy Seraph standalone, or get all four of them with Witch Queen Deluxe, though I don't recommend it at this point. In this post I'll go over how to get started on each of them, and some recommendations.

The parts where I pitch some of the legendary weapons are just my opinion, so take them a grain of salt. Almost every weapon is *someone*'s favorite. We don't know if and how the seasonal weapons will be available next season, and I suspect it won't really be realistic to unlock crafting for them after these seasons disappear, so the time is now. Each season has six seasonal weapons, and Haunted and Seraph have four additional returning weapons (Opulent and Ikelos, respectively).

The two exotic missions included here are *not* leaving the game - they'll be part of the new exotic mission rotator after Lightfall launches. None of the exotics will become unobtainable - there will still be a way to get all of them next season, as long as you own Witch Queen.

# Season of the Risen

* **How to Start:** For this season, first you have to do the first two chapters of the witch queen campaign, ""The Arrival"" and ""The Investigation."" Then speak to Ikora in the Enclave, and she'll give you the ""Rising Tensions"" quest.
* Main Quest: After rising tensions, you'll get the main questline, ""Operation Elbrus""
* War Table Upgrades: You unlock upgrades for the war table by completing seasonal challenges. These are under the ""Past Challenges"" section in the normal challenges tab. You'll complete them naturally by working through Operation Elbrus. There are two upgrades to target: ""Deepsight Requision"" (the 4th in the first row), which allows you to focus an umbral for a deepsight weapon every day (the description still says weekly, but they updated all these to be daily); and ""Umbral Energy Requisition"" (2nd in the 2nd row), which causes umbral energy to drop from everything.
* Exotics: As you work through Operation Elbrus, you'll be given access to the Vox Obscura exotic activity (on the map in the throne world), which gives the [Dead Messenger](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2812324401/dead-messenger/) grenade launcher. The other exotic from this season, [Grand Overture](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1763584999/grand-overture/), is in the kiosk in the tower.
* Legendary Weapons: None of these are must-have, but several are solid.
   * Explosive Personality is the only solar wave frame, and the Auto-Loading + Disruption Break roll is solid in pvp - if you hit someone with it, you can finish them off with a body shot from a kinetic 120 hand cannon (or thorn) thanks to the debuff form Disruption Break.
   * The bow Under Your Skin is a solid PvE workhorse kind of weapon - I'm a big fan of Hip-Fire Grip + Explosive Head. If you're not into hip-firing, it can also get the more traditional god roll of Archer's Tempo + Explosive/Successful Warm-Up/Dragonfly.
   * Thoughtless is the only stasis sniper, and can be a pretty good ""after you run out of heavy"" DPS option in PvE thanks to Enhanced Overflow + Firing Line. Headstone is kind of cute in pvp, preventing rezzes in modes like Trials.
   * Peace of Mind is a great rapdid-fire pulse for pvp, if that archetype is your jam
* Armor: Focusing engrams at the war table is a great way to get high-stat armor, because you can get umbral energy passively while you play other stuff thanks to the upgrade.

# Season of the Haunted

* **How to Start**: This begins with the quest ""Operation Midas"", which you can launch from the bottom-left of the map on the moon.
* Main Quest: After you finish Operation Midas, head to the helm and talk to the crown of sorrow (in the left wing) and you'll get the ""Bound in Sorrow"" questline.
* Crown of Sorrow Upgrades: Like all seasons, you unlock these by doing seasonal challenges. Pay attention to how several of these ask you to use specific weapons or elements. Note that the scythe does solar damage, so using it will cause you to fail challenges like ""Emtpy Greif"", which asks you do use only void, stasis and kinetic damage in Sever. The first priority for upgrades is the one that lets you focus a deepsight every day (the sixth in the first row).
* Exotics: There's no exotic quest this season - the Duality dungeon replaces it, but that's not included in the season. The season pass exotic, [Trespasser](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1234150730/trespasser/), is in the kiosk.
* Legendary Weapons: There are a lot of bangers here. For the opulent weapons, you must first get them from opulent chests on the leviathan before you can focus them. f2p players can farm these chests. The four opulent weapons are separate from the six seasonal weapons, but the guaranteed deepsight is shared between them.
   * Austringer is a top-tier 140 handcannon for PvP, in large part thanks to being craftable with a good perk pool.
   * Beloved is one of the pest PvP snipers, thanks to it's low zoom, good perks and craftability.
   * Drang (baroque) is an excellent sidearm for PvP, and PvE too if you're into that.
   * Calus Mini-Tool with incandescent is one of the best PvE primaries, especially for solar builds. If only it had a better reload perk.
   * Hollow Denial is an excellent trace rifle for void builds, look for Lead From Gold (which is clutch on a trace rifle) + Repulor Brace.
   * Nezarec's Whisper is the glaive to use in PvP, thanks to Impulse Amplifier + Unstoppable Force. It also gets the wombo combo of Genesis + Adaptive munitions in pve if you're into that.
   * Bump in the Night is a good DPS rocket that does stasis damage, and might be even more relevant next season with the linear nerfs.
   * Without Remorse is one of the best lightweight shotguns for pvp, but that archetype in general was hit pretty hard by the spread changes. Can be fun in pve with incandescent too.
* Armor: This is the season to play if you want to actively farm high-stat armor. You can't get umbral energy playing other stuff like you can with Risen, but if you want to target farm it, Nightmare Containment is more efficient than Psiops Battlegrounds. It also drops ascendant alloy once in a while. If you're farming containment, make sure to run a sever every time you get a Bound Presence, which will be every 4 or 5 runs.

# Season of Plunder

* **How to Start**: Start with the mission ""Ahoy and Aweigh"", which is on the map in the helm.
* Main Quest: Afterward, you'll get the main ""Sails of the Shipstealer"" quest.
* Star Chart Upgrades: Pay attention to the objectives on the seasonal challenges, many of them ask you to do something specific in the seasonal activities. The one that gives a daily deepsight is 5th in the first row. **If you see teammates throwing away engrams during Expeditions, they're trying to extend the phase to get a ruffian (champion) to spawn for one of these challenges.**
* Exotics: There's no exotic quest this season either, with King's Fall taking it's place. If you own this season, you can claim the season pass exotic, [Delicate Tomb](https://www.light.gg/db/items/374573733/delicate-tomb/), from the rank 1 reward from the season pass (even if you just got the season) though bungie's website or the companion app.
* Legendary Gear:
   * Blood Feud is a good 750 RPM stasis SMG. For some uses it's overshadowed by Prolonged Engagement (which is 900 RPM), but Blood Feud is a personal favorite of mine to use with stasis hunter.
   * Tarnished Mettle is one of several strong arc scout rifles for endgame content like GMs, especially with Voltshot.
   * Brigand's Law is a sidearm that gets voltshot and can thus really shred through ads in pve, though it's a bit overshadowed by the Ikelos SMG these days.

# Season of the Seraph

* **How to Start**: This starts with the mission ""Hierarchy,"" which is on the left side of the map on Europa.
* Main Quest: This leads into the main quest, ""More than a Weapon.""
* Exo Frame Upgrades: Since this is the current season there are a ton of challenges, but only a couple of them each week give upgrades. The perk that lets you focus guaranteed deepsights each day is last in the first row.  You'll also want the ""Umbral Activities"" upgrade, 4th in the first row, which makes umbral energy drop from non-seasonal activities.
* Exotics: The main seasonal quest will bounce you back and forth with the ""Should you Choose to Accept It"" exotic quest, which culminates with the ""Operation: Seraph Shield"" mission, which will give you [Revision Zero](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1473821207/revision-zero/). This mission is Destiny at it's best. Your first Revision Zero will be a deepsight and have a ? for one of the perks - go ahead and dismantle it to get the pattern, then head to the enclave to craft it for real. The season pass exotic is [The Manticore](https://www.light.gg/db/items/219145368/the-manticore/).
* Legendary Weapons: To get the Ikelos weapons, find the Resonance Amp in your consumables inventory. Use it to consume four Resonant Stems (which drop from battlegrounds) to get a hint to a location of a Warmind Node somewhere in the world. Find it and interact to get an Ikelos weapon. I recommend getting all of these (you'll get at least one guaranteed deepsight for each weapon), and you have to get a weapon this way before you can focus engrams for it. Once you've gotten all the nodes, focusing engrams is the only way to get ikelos weapons.
   * **IKELOS\_SMG\_v1.0.3**: This is perhaps the best weapon in destiny thanks to the feeding frenzy + voltshot roll. If you don't do anything else with these seasons, **get this gun**.
   * Judgment of Kelgorath: This is the best glaive to use in PvE thanks to the new perk Close to Melee. It buffs the damage of the glaive melee, and it stacks with other melee damage buffs like Synthoceps and Offensive Bulwark.
   * Tripwire Canary: This is an excellent PvE workhorse with Frenzy + Dragonfly. It's the only bow that doesn't make you choose between the lethality of a damage perk and the ad clear potential of Dragonfly (which was recently buffed - it now behaves at base how it used to with Dragonfly Spec).
   * Path of Least Resistance: This is the only legendary arc trace rifle, and sweet with Arc 3.0 builds. It's one of the best weapons to use with Spark of Becons, because it's a special weapon that you use like a primary.
   * Fire and Forget: This is one of only two burst-fire linear fusions, and a good DPS weapon as a result with Field Prep + Focused Fury.
   * Disparity: This is another good PvE workhorse type weapon, and a good thing to swap in for Revision Zero if you need to run another exotic.
   * Retrofit Escapade: Machine Guns aren't the best DPS weapons, but this is the best DPS a machine gun can get, thanks to the rapid-fire archetype an the 4TTC+Target Lock combo. It's particularly fun with volatile rounds (hello Gyrfalcon's), but not broken and crazy like it used to be.

# TL;DR that's still TL

The starting missions for each season are:

* Risen: ""Rising Tensions,"" which you get from Ikora after completing the first 2 WQ campaign missions.
* Haunted: ""Operation Midas,"" on the map on the moon.
* Plunder: ""Ahoy and Aweigh,"" on the map in the HELM.
* Seraph: ""Hierarchy,"" on the map on Europa.

Prioritize getting the vendor upgrades that let you focus a deepsight weapon every day. If you do nothing else, play enough of Season of the Seraph to craft the Ikelos SMG. If you want to farm high-stat armor, play Season of the Haunted.

Do you have a more systematic way to approach debugging serial connections? What I do always feels like a hack.

My job involves integrating a bunch of new serial-based sensors & devices into an existing software/hardware stack. And I always feel like I'm stabbing around in the dark when it comes to debugging serial connections. So I wonder if you guys have any tips or tricks for debugging unknown serial connections?

**Here's how I start:**

* Using a manual, find a default baud rate & other settings for the device. Usually it's safe to start on 9600 8-N-1, but that doesn't always work.
* I don't usually step baud rate up because that's future setup overhead for the device, but maybe I should?
* I look in a manual for whatever command sets the device has.
* Figure out if it's a line-based (newlines) protocol or a character-based protocol (send a complete hex command, get something back). And if it's line based, do I need to use CR, LF, or both?
* I send some commands with a terminal emulator (I use minicom) and see what I get back.
* Write some code to send commands & parse responses, usually in Python.
* Curse a lot when something breaks and I have to build in a bunch of error handling.

**Some ongoing questions:**

* What's the best way to figure out which port the device is on? I usually just try all the ports until I get a response, but that's a pain. I've written tools to ping all ports & look for a response, but that's not always reliable. I understand that custom UDEV rules could help specify which port a device connects to, but it seems like a pretty deep topic and I haven't dived in yet.
* Are there some best practices to deal with unexpected values on the connection? We set up software to interact with devices without human interaction, but we've had to build in a lot of ""if you see this, do this"" logic to deal with unexpected values. I'm not sure if that's just the nature of the beast, or if there's a better way.
* Is there some theory about when a serial connection dies and resets? I've often disconnected and found I can't reconnect to a device for 30+ seconds. In those circumstances my strategy is ""try starting the software again after a while"", but I'd love to know more about what's going on.",False,False,ElectricalEngineering,Looking for a layman's guide to debugging serial connections,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/1abp1zz/looking_for_a_laymans_guide_to_debugging_serial/

Hello, 

I am a 4th year student from Turkey that wants to apply to Erasmus university after this year for my masters. I would like to pursue Economics or econometrics but i am concerned because my gpa is not that great (3.0 right now). I am doing a double major in Industrial Engineering and Economics. I get lower marks from courses from engineering program, B's and C's. However i got an A from all of the classes i took for my econ program, accounting, finance, micro 1-2 macro 1-2 and some electives.
I've also worked as a data scientist part time after my first year and that also lowers my grades quite a bit. My university is not that well credentialed compared to Erasmus university, although it's top 1 or 2 in my country. I was wondering if my hopes of studying here is realistic. Do all students have gpa's higher than 3.0? Does my work experience in data science help my admission in an econometrics program? I don't expect a direct response to my questions but any thoughts from here will be very insightful to me. I am sorry if this type of question is very vague and inappropriate for this subreddit. 


Edit: i got c's for my math classes because my calculus is not great and i took the ones in my engineering program (harder curve, at least in my school). I also suspect this is not ideal applying for a master in economics or econometrics.

I’m working on a project where I need to predict **mobile banking activity** (active vs inactive) for May 2024 based on customer data. My dataset has around **19K records**, and I’m facing challenges with handling time series data, especially related to **last login dates**. Here’s the full context:

### Dataset Overview:  

- **Customer Record Data**: I have **four months of customer records** from **February to May 2024**. The customer record field essentially tracks when the customer’s data was recorded.  

- **Last Login Dates**: I also have **last mobile banking login dates** ranging from **2015 to June 2024**. The last login field indicates if a customer logged in within the past six months, and this has shown to be highly predictive of whether the customer is active. However, I’m worried this could lead to leakage.  

- **Target Variable (Mobile Banking Status)**: The target variable is binary, with **72.1% active** and **27.8% inactive**.

### Current Approach:

I’m trying to predict **activity status for May 2024** by:
- **Training set**: Using **February, March, and April 2024** customer record data.
- **Testing set**: Using **May 2024** customer record data.

- **Last Login Date**: The last login dates range from **January to June 2024**. My initial thought was to exclude **June 2024** login data from training to avoid leakage and also exclude **January 2024** from testing. I was also considering excluding **May 2024 last login** from the training set since it's too close to the target month (May).

### Challenges:  
1. **Handling Time Series Data**:  

I’m not sure if I should be considering last login data as part of a time series analysis. The last login date just indicates whether a customer logged in at least once in the past six months, and my dataset spans several years (2015-2024). Some of the last login dates go as far back as 2015, while others are from 2024. However, from a temporal perspective, there’s no real “sequence” of events that indicates customer activity over time, only whether they logged in or not. Would this still be classified as time series data? Or am I misinterpreting the data structure?

2. **Feature Leakage Concerns**:  

 Since last login dates extend into **June 2024** and I’m predicting **May 2024**, I’m worried that using these dates will cause feature leakage, especially if I use the wrong set of last login dates for training and testing. The last login date seems to dominate the feature importance in my model (I used **XGBoost** for feature importance), which could indicate it’s contributing too much, possibly because of leakage. How should I handle this? Should I completely exclude last login data from training or testing?

3. **Imbalanced Class Distribution**:  

The dataset has a **class imbalance**—about 72.1% of the data is for **active customers**, while 27.8% is **inactive**. I’ve been using **SMOTE** for oversampling, but I’m not sure if it’s the best approach given the relatively small size of the dataset (19K records). Would techniques like **undersampling** or different class weighting be more appropriate?


4. **Model Selection & Performance**:  

I’ve been using **XGBoost** with **Fourier Transform (FFT)** on the last login dates as part of feature engineering. The model is performing okay, but I’m still concerned about overfitting to the last login dates or not capturing enough meaningful patterns in the data. Given that I’m working with **19K records** and this is a classification problem, are there other models or techniques I should consider that are more suited to my dataset size and structure? I’ve also experimented with regularization techniques like **L2 regularization** to reduce overfitting.

The concern is that this feature might be doing all the heavy lifting in the prediction, and my model may be relying too much on it. However, when I ran a feature importance analysis with **XGBoost**, here are the top features:

### Top Features:

1. **Credit Usage** – 0.35
2. **Last Login Days** – 0.28
3. **Secondary Card Usage** – 0.12
4. **Account Holding Status** – 0.09
5. **Customer Region** – 0.08
6. **Customer Age** – 0.07
7. **Employer Sector** – 0.06


### Additional Context:

- The last login field, according to a friend of mine, only captures whether the customer logged in at least once within the past six months, with no information on transaction frequency or other activity. 

- The data spans multiple years, but my focus is on predicting May 2024, and I’m not sure if using previous years' data is adding noise or helping the model.

### Questions:

- Can I proceed with this approach (three months training + one month testing) while excluding certain last login dates (e.g., June 2024) to prevent leakage?

- Is the **last login field** as problematic as it seems, or is there a better way to handle it in terms of feature engineering?

- How can I better handle the **class imbalance** in this dataset, and are there techniques better suited to small datasets like mine?

- Should I be doing more time series analysis for this task, or should I treat this more like a standard classification problem?

Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Thanks so much!

This is gonna be a long post. 

I’ve been working on a machine learning project that involves predicting customer behavior based on time series data, and I ran into an interesting challenge regarding **dates**. Specifically, I’m working with a dataset where the target variable (let's call it **activity_status**) is based on whether a customer has logged into their mobile banking app in the past six months. Essentially, the **last login date** has a high correlation with this target variable, and it got me thinking about how tricky dates can be to work with in ML, but also how powerful they can be if handled properly.

The Challenge with Dates:

1. Raw dates are difficult for models to interpret directly.

2. Aggregating dates or time intervals can sometimes lead to loss of valuable temporal patterns.

3. Frequent events (like multiple logins) can cause redundancy or noise in the data, affecting the model's performance.

For example, in my case, customers who logged in frequently could lead to repeated values for ""days since last login,"" which introduces redundancy. 

However, that same ""days since last login"" feature has an extremely high correlation with my target variable because the **activity_status** is defined based on whether a login occurred within the last six months.

After some experimentation, I found that engineering features around dates can significantly boost model performance:

- Calculating the time difference between the current date and the last event (in my case, last login) is usually more effective than feeding raw date values into the model.

- Tracking frequency: If you have time-based events like logins, you can create features such as the **number of events in the past 30 or 60 days** to capture patterns of engagement.

- Trends: You can even look at login or transaction trends over time (e.g., increasing, decreasing, stable) to add more context.

My Question to You – Best Approach for Time Series Data?

Since my dataset is time series-based, I’m curious to hear how others approach handling dates in machine learning, particularly when the date feature has a high correlation with the target variable. Specifically:

- How do you deal with dates when they're the main driver of a target variable (like in my case with login dates)?

- For frequent events (like logins or transactions), do you aggregate the data, and if so, how do you prevent losing important temporal details?

- Any suggestions for maintaining a balance between simplicity (e.g., days since last login) and capturing more complex patterns like frequency or trends?

I’m facing an issue particularly with the high correlation of this feature, it is concerning because it becomes the dominant feature contributing more to the model, which I am afraid it could be data leakage. I am not sure how to handle dates so I would really appreciate your help in this area. 

Also, I have three months of customer data and **two months of transaction data**, but the activity status is based on whether the customer logged in within the past six months. Can I still make accurate predictions with this limited data? Since the rule for activity status is just based on last login, I’m wondering if I can use machine learning to create my own rule for predicting activity status, even though I don’t have a full six months of data. 

Any bright ideas?? Waiting for your responses!
