In other words, I'm only interested in subjects that are generally mandatory throughout all of high school. Personally, I know physics was NOT a mandatory subject at my school, and if that policy scales to most of the rest of the country, I would not be interested in what the opinions of physics are. I'm trying to study and better understand what subjects people have respect—and to some extent admiration—for regardless of if they did well in them. I did not do particularly well in my high school biology course, but my opinions of biology of a subject were never negative, just my opinions of the textbook, teacher, etc. I would like to know if there are any datasets that probe at *this* particular aspect high school classes. My gut feeling is that mathematics class leave more people with a genuine distain for the subject itself more so than people would have with an art class, even though, for example, the frequency of people unable to paint a fence after an art class might be comparable with that of the people unable to find the zeros of a quadratic equation. Normally, I would put a lot more effort into tracking down this kind of data myself, but this endeavor would be best described as a side-side project and can't afford myself to get too sidetracked on it.

So I am a data analyst. And spent yesterday fetching hot reddit posts for top subreddits as an EDA activity. I fetched the common parameters like post title, url, upvotes, number of comments, shares, etc. Removed the 'author' (userid of person who made the post) for privacy reasons.

I am thinking of uploading the dataset to Kaggle for other fellow analysts and researchers, under the Reddit API Terms license available on Kaggle.

I am relatively new to python, pandas. Recently getting better.  
So I wanted to do an EDA on top reddit posts of all time. I couldn't find something concise. I saw a few datasets in 100s of GBs or 1 TB + of entire data dumps by pushshift. But that was too much for me to go through.

I wanted something simpler, lightweight for myself and potentially other newbies to get their feet wet when coming into analytics.

So I wrote a script and had to take chatgpt help for debugging (pardon my poor coding skills, im not from a programming background) to use reddits api to fetch top posts from top 50 subreddits.

I did a bit of data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure the formatting was ok, removed the OP(author) field for privacy.

Uploaded to Kaggle and prepared a starter notebook.

The script needs work, cleanup and commenting, and updates to ensure I don't fetch OP info in the first place. Will also try to fetch some other necessary parameters. When finalized, will share that on github. (I do not know how to use github yet, again sorry).

Thanks for your time.

I hope to find some interesting datasets on r/datasets for my eda as well.

Hello!


 Does anyone know any good sources of music statistics? I am studying sound production at uni and part of the course requires us to do research on marketing and promotion. 

I thought that looking at statistics and weaving that into the report would be a good idea but i cant find anything that's specific enough and if it is it will be behind a pay wall.

the genre we are researching is punk but I can find a way to tie in a wider genre if punk is too specific.

This is my first post in this sub. I am looking for a dataset that I would've assumed would be easy to find but I'm having no luck :( As the US politics has been a recent fixation for me, a small project I would like to start involves looking at currently tipped occupations (ie waiters, cashiers, hair salons etc) and comparing the income that comes from tips currently to what we will observe in the future due to both parties (Dem and Rep) committing to a tax free tip policy. So far the closest dataset I have found is [this ](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353031.htm)from the US bureau of labor stats however it only details their gross pay (I'm assuming this means pre tax) and includes the tips. This doesn't help much because as a part of this project I would like to answer the questions;

(i) Will these occupations force more tips onto consumers due to the policy change?

(ii) Will other occupations that don't currently get tipped begin to take tips in order to get more tax free income?

I unfortunately don't see how I can answer these questions if the tips are included and the numbers are pre tax :(

My question is, can I train a OPEN AI or another model to parse the information that I need from these PDFs and make it spit output in purely a JSON structure that I want? So I can use OPEN AIs' API and integrate it in our backend services to do all of the work. Do you guys think this is possible?

If you're working on any e-commerce, market analysis, or comparison projects, this could be a helpful tool for you.

* Real-time Product Search: Fetch detailed Amazon product information based on keywords, categories, or ASINs.
* Comprehensive Data: Access pricing, availability, ratings, and more across various product categories.

# Why I built it:

I noticed a gap in easy access to Amazon's massive product catalog for smaller developers and side projects, so I decided to create this API to fill that gap. It’s designed to be straightforward and developer-friendly, aiming to save time and effort when integrating Amazon product data.

Dataset Requirements:

Mouse Movement Data: Raw data capturing mouse coordinates, velocity, acceleration, and direction changes as users interact with a web page.

Click Event Data; Records of click positions, timing, and frequency to analyze the decision-making process and interaction speed.

Human vs. Bot Interaction: Clear distinction between data generated by human users and data generated by automated scripts (bots). This will allow for supervised learning and model training.

Time-Series Data: Sequential data capturing the timestamp of each mouse event to analyze the flow and pattern of movements.

Behavioral Biometrics: Data capturing user-specific behaviors that might indicate human-like randomness or bot-like precision in interactions.

Variety of Interactions: Diverse interaction scenarios, including different types of CAPTCHA challenges (e.g., image recognition, text entry) and general web browsing activities.

I have a dataset of BIC and am doing a master data template. The template also wants me to put in the banks name. Is there any resource where I can get a table of BIC codes with bank names I can then use to fill in the name slots via lookups?

I've found sites that convert the BIC codes, unfortunately one by one and I have cca 2k entries...

Any help would be appreciated! Thx",False,False,datasets,BIC (Bank Identifier Code) to Bank Name?!,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1ewsio2/bic_bank_identifier_code_to_bank_name/

I’m a data science researcher focusing on process engineering and optimization, and I’m looking to further strengthen my knowledge through different use cases. I’m reaching out for recommendations on extensively large datasets that can be processed using cloud platforms.

My goal is to create an end-to-end Data Science/Data Engineering project that involves ingesting these large datasets and applying domain knowledge to derive insights. I’m particularly interested in \*\*time series\*\* modeling, which is crucial for capturing temporal trends.

Some areas I’m considering include:

* Oil and gas unit operations datasets
* Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) datasets
* FMCG manufacturing datasets, such as edible oil or biomass production
* Water treatment units, especially where time-sensitive data is key

To give you an idea of my background, I’ve worked on modeling and optimization in amine treating, sulfur recovery, and carbon capture datasets. I’ve also successfully developed an anomaly detection model for the Tennessee Eastman process. However, I’m eager to dive deeper into time series modeling for my next project.

**Major requirements:**

* Focus on time series data
* Can involve classification or regression tasks
* Comparatively large datasets with many columns (variables) and datapoints

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or pointers to datasets that align with what I mentioned.

Thanks in Advance!",False,False,datasets,Recommendations for Extensive Datasets in Process Engineering and Optimization for End-to-End DS/DE Projects,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1ewpqup/recommendations_for_extensive_datasets_in_process/
