1,santiviquez,"At work, we wrote a blog about exactly that: [Retraining is not all you need](https://www.nannyml.com/blog/retraining-is-not-all-you-need).

Here is a summary:

ML models tend to fail due to mainly these three reasons:

1. Severe data drift
2. Concept drift
3. Data quality issues

And retraining would only help in one!

* **If covariate shift causes the performance to drop:** Retraining only partially solves the issue or might not solve it at all. This is because a change in the distribution of the input data doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship between features and targets has changed.
* **If concept drift causes the performance to drop:** Retraining does help! Because the relationship between the model's inputs and outputs changes. So, we need to retrain the model to learn the new concept.
* **If data quality issues cause the performance to drop:** Retraining doesn't help. Broken data pipelines, changes in the data collection processes, and data inconsistencies might cause the model to fail, and it is unlikely that retraining would fix all of that. If data quality issues are causing a model to fail, then we need to fix those upstream.

Hope this helps.","<div class=""md""><p>At work, we wrote a blog about exactly that: <a href=""https://www.nannyml.com/blog/retraining-is-not-all-you-need"">Retraining is not all you need</a>.</p>

My experience with gravel driveways is that a blowtorch will kill vegetation. Often not down to the root. And it continues to germinate and grow back in the future. In practice use ground clear, then come back a few days later and burn the dried out parts grown through the gravel. This is never ending work. *Better* is to hit the gravel with some form of pre-emergent which allows for less maintenance. Personally avoid salts because as a long term system eventually I expect salts to migrate.

Applying gravel observations to your case, I predict the torch to immediately singe without necessarily killing roots. Get regrowth fairly quick and have to do it again repeatedly.

If you want to keep your original setup with the tags \`#Dermatology/Lecture/(number)\` then the following dataviewjs code should work:

185,lakeland_nz,"This isn't investing in a company.  This is buying shares in a company off someone - transferring ownership of a company.

Minimum wage is around $28,000 USD. Most people can create a business that generates as much income as their day job.  That is... imagine you're a hairdresser earning $60k/year as an employee.  Become self employed and unless you're usually good or bad at business, you'll earn a little over $60k/year.  So if I see a business earning approximately a wage, being sold for about a wage, then I get mighty suspicious.

You've been offered 25% share for $25,000, meaning the company is valued at $100k.  Since the money is going straight to the other person rather than being invested in the company it's technically both a pre-money and post-money valuation.  A company worth $100k is expected to return a bit over $100k of profit to its owners over and above market rate salaries.  It's harder for startups, because you're estimating the very low probability for a very high return.

I would use a different approach.  Right now you own 0% and your friend owns 100%.  We'll value the company at US$100k - maybe that's generous but there isn't enough information here to know.  Let's absolutely rule out giving the other shareholder money and instead only consider investing in the company.

Let's add your US$25k.  Now the company is worth $125k and has $25k cash.  You own $25k of $125k (20%) while your friend owns 80%.  Then you start putting in 10hrs/wk.  Every hour you put in is worth ($50/hr (or whatever you choose).  Every hour your friend puts in is worth $50/hr (or whatever you choose).  Over time the shareholding between you and your friend should shift up and down depending on your relative contributions.  

There's a name (and a book) for this technique, called 'slicing pie'.  I've oversimplified it here (cold, hard cash is worth more equity in the proper system).  Anyway if you're interested then you can read about it.   But I'm nervous about how much the suggestion to you deviates.... Especially the idea that this money goes into your friends' bank account rather than the company's","<div class=""md""><p>This isn&#39;t investing in a company.

However, SARIMA is extremely slower than MA or Lightgbm, so it would take forever to run on all households. Anyway, I’m open to suggestion on how to do all 1000 time series with SARIMA in a reasonable amount of time if you have any</p>

As far as means and reporting numbers to the business goes, here is some extra info to consider:

The arithmetic mean of arithmetic means is only guaranteed to be the same as the overall mean when the sample sizes within groups are the same. So the two ways of aggregating results have different underlying meanings when sample size is different.

In general, a mean is just a way to represent something about a bunch of objects with a single number. There are different types of means. For examples of different means, you can look up harmonic and geometric means.

In a business context, I'd argue if you are reporting any metric, make sure you understand what it is you're saying with that number and consider how a non-technical person will interpret the result.

<p>In a business context, I&#39;d argue if you are reporting any metric, make sure you understand what it is you&#39;re saying with that number and consider how a non-technical person will interpret the result. If you can justify your decision and document it properly, you&#39;re probably fine.</p>

1. \*\*DBDiagram.io\*\*: A simple, browser-based tool for creating entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs). You can write the schema in text format, and it will generate the diagram for you. It’s quick and great for smaller to medium-sized databases.



2. \*\*MySQL Workbench\*\*: Offers a comprehensive visual database design tool that allows you to create and manage ER diagrams, visualize primary/foreign keys, and much more. It's widely used in MySQL environments but also supports other databases.



3. \*\*pgModeler\*\*: An open-source data modeling tool for PostgreSQL. It provides a clear and detailed ERD interface, making it easy to visualize relationships and work with complex databases.



4. \*\*ER/Studio\*\*: A robust, professional-grade tool that allows you to visualize, manage, and document database relationships. It’s more enterprise-focused and offers collaboration features for team projects.



5. \*\*Lucidchart\*\*: A general diagramming tool that supports ERDs. It’s cloud-based, easy to use, and integrates with platforms like Confluence, which is helpful for documentation and team collaboration.



6. \*\*dbSchema\*\*: A database design and management tool that supports visualizing complex table relationships. It works with multiple database systems and offers additional features like data exploration and query building.



7. \*\*Microsoft Visio\*\*: A general-purpose diagram tool that can also be used to create ERDs with templates for database structures.

417,OpenAITutor,"LLMs (Large Language Models) have generated a lot of buzz, but whether they're worth the investment for you depends on a few factors:



1. \*\*Growing Industry Adoption\*\*: LLMs are rapidly being applied across industries for customer support, content generation, code automation, and more. If you believe LLMs will continue to disrupt these sectors, developing expertise in LLM training, fine-tuning, and deployment could make you highly marketable.



2. \*\*Complementing Your Skillset\*\*: With your data science and ML background, LLM knowledge could complement your existing skills. LLMs are becoming a crucial part of the AI toolkit, and integrating them with traditional methods (e.g., RAG, hybrid models) is where significant innovation is happening.



3. \*\*Business Value Uncertainty\*\*: You're right to question their business impact. While LLMs are powerful, the ROI isn’t always immediate or clear-cut. For some businesses, traditional ML models might still deliver better results in terms of revenue and operational efficiency. However, the potential of LLMs in automating complex workflows and generating actionable insights is undeniable and growing.



4. \*\*Alternative Areas of Study\*\*: If your goal is business value and practical outcomes, other fields like MLOps, causal inference, or business-focused areas of ML (e.g., demand forecasting, churn prediction) might provide more immediate value. These areas are more established in driving ROI.



In summary, LLMs are certainly not overhyped but may not immediately displace traditional methods in all cases. If your interest in LLMs aligns with industry trends and your existing skills, it’s likely a worthwhile investment. If you're seeking immediate, proven business outcomes, other areas might offer more concrete returns in the short term.

One thing I've learn is that the education I received in LATAM was comparable or even deeper than what Europeans get. In my country it takes 5 years to get a professional degree and it's almost the equivalent of a BSc+MSc here (of course this varies depending on what uni you study and what subject. I happened to study physics in one of the best universities in the country). One thing worth mentioning tho is that Europeans often start working very earlier in their careers and doing internships and stuff like that. This was something new to me. So despite having a shorter education and not very in depth compare to LATAM, they get a lot of work experience and I'd say that is sometimes even more valuable than knowing lots of theoretical stuff.

Saying that, I notice lots of LATAM people over prepare and become very skillful professionals precisely because of that mentality of thinking we are below European level so we want to get to their level.

I think a really good example of this is ""The Free Trial"".  A trial is itself a means of allowing users to discover value, but during the trial you can look to see what features the users interacted with.  In short you can:

* Look at the time period during the trial
* Construct features on what users interacted with, how many times, what calls to action they saw, etc.
* Look at the next 30/60/90/whatever days and determine who got some outcome (e.g. paid for a subscription).
* You can then correlate the features with the outcome via a regression model.  You could even use causal inference to estimate the ATT/ATC/ATE/Whatever estimand

That allows you to make hypotheses like ""Users who interact in this way were X% more likely to pay us"".  Then, can validate that by looking at other cohorts, running experiments, etc.  You test/refine/retest the hypothesis until it is this crystallized piece of knowledge or rule of thumb like the facebook example.

In tech, early success with a product is a really good signal for finding value.  Facebook's 3 friends in 5 days is an example of that (seeing what the value of the platform is).  At my old company, we began to experiment with something like this, but it was still early days.  Its why so many platforms try to give you a tour, or give you call to actions to try new features.  They want you to find value, because if you find value then there is a good chance you stick around and give the platform money!

You're right when you say "" someone doing it naturally is different compared to if you were pushed artificially to do something"" -- just because I give you 3 friends on day 3 does not mean you will become a daily active user on facebook.  Rather, the treatment -- a coupon, a call to action, etc -- is intended to remove friction or encourage users to try to perform an action IN ORDER TO POSSIBLY FIND VALUE.

This is why experimentation and measurement are so important.  estimating the average treatment effect on the untreated with probably over state the effect of the intervention -- mostly because the intervention is novel, and the ""treatment"" in whatever causal analysis you do is not the same as removing friction to the treatment.

In any case, this is a tough problem to get right, but in my experience the tools you're looking for are causal inference + experimentation.

I'm applying to Lead/Manager/Senior Manager level titles now.  I can't help but think my previous job title is holding me back somewhat.  If the recruiter sees two resumes:

1. Unknown company - data scientist

In my experience at my own company, as well as interviewing at companies like Amazon, Doordash, and Meta, the SQL round is a pass/fail. If you fail it, it doesn't matter how well you did in the other rounds, unfortunately. If you can't pass the SQL round, you just need more practice. When I was interviewing for product data roles, I grinded SQL interview questions, about 10 per day using [Stratascratch](https://stratascratch.com/?via=productanalyst).
