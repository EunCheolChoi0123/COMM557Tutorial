The explanatory variables used are the XAU in US dollars, the BRENT futures price, the Standard and Poor’s 500 (SPX), and the EURO. The XAU was selected because gold is used as a refuge in crisis periods and is a predictor of poor economic performance. The SPX was chosen because it is a good predictor of US and world economic performance. The EURO can serve as a buffer against or dampen the effects of inflation when energy prices rise. BRENT is an energy alternative to NG for two reasons: substitution and comovement in economic trends.

The point of this post is not to blame the authors, I'm just very surprised by the review process.

I just stumbled upon this paper. While I find the ideas somewhat interesting, I found the overall results and justifications to be very weak.   
It was a clear reject from ICLR2022, mainly for a lack of any theoretical justifications. [https://openreview.net/forum?id=slHNW9yRie0](https://openreview.net/forum?id=slHNW9yRie0)

I don't really get how it could have made it through the review process of NeurIPS. The whole thing is very preliminary and is basically just consisting of experiments.  
It even llack citations of other very closely related work such as *Generative Modelling With Inverse Heat Dissipation* [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397) which is basically their ""blurring diffusion"" but with theoretical background and better results (which was accepted to ICLR2023)...

I thought NeurIPS was on the same level as ICLR, but now it seems to me sometimes papers just get randomly accepted.

So I was wondering, if anyone had an opinion on this, or if you have encountered other similar cases ?

On the other hand, True Negatives include rejecting faces that are fully or partially covered by scarves or masks, faces that are only partially visible, or faces with orientations exceeding a set threshold. The system should also avoid detecting multiple faces in the frame, regardless of their distance from the camera, as well as situations where more than one partially visible face is present in the frame. This ensures that only the desired face configurations are positively detected while avoiding ambiguous or unintended cases.

I have tried the multimodal approach in which I have done multiple face detection with Yunet.onnx model which is giving pretty good results. After that for face orientation, I used Mediapipe, calculated the neck and nose slope and shoulder slope, and set the threshold values after thorough calibration and it is also working fine.

**What is it?** Tetris Gymnasium is a clean implementation of Tetris as a Reinforcement Learning environment and integrates with Gymnasium. It can be customized (e.g. board dimensions, gravity, ...) and includes many examples on how to use it like training scripts.

**Why Tetris?** Despite significant progress in RL for many Atari games, Tetris remains a challenging problem for AI. Its combination of NP-hard complexity, stochastic elements, and need for long-term planning make it a persistent open problem in RL research. There's to date no publication that works well with the game which is not using hand-crafted feature vectors or other simplifications.

**What can I use it for?** Please don't hesitate to try out the environment to get into Reinforcement Learning. The good thing is that Tetris is easy to understand, and you can watch the agent play and see the errors it makes clearly. If you're already into RL, you can use it as a customizable environment that integrates well with other frameworks like Gymnasium and W&B.

I had an idea for quick and efficient interpretability but I want to check whether this is a sound way of doing things.

Essentially, run the model as normal and produce a classification and distance value (like it currently does). Then, re-run the model once for each feature (e.g., 30 features = 30 additional runs). For each run:

* Zero the Z-score of the feature of interest,
* Re-run the prediction and produce a new distance value. Compare this new value to the original value to produce an 'offset'
* Save and report these 30 offsets and rank them based on the |abs|. The signedness of the offset indicates the directionality of the impact to the final prediction

There were two separate research topics we worked on but I am referencing the 2nd one. This professor is a data science professor that specializes and teaches machine learning and is from a different school in my university. 

So when I met him the 2nd project was machine learning based with some Bioinformatics and of course I needed to do everything. He would give me tips and try to understand the stuff with me but he doesn't do Bioinformatics so I needed to figure the preprocessing stuff out alone which wasn't the hard part.
The hard part was trying to figure out how to get the ML tool he or other students that were there before me choose to use for the task. Those two students left without contributing much and they were computer science majors lol. This ML tool had lots of problems and wasn't fully documented. None the less I got it working on the schools hpc.

Long story short the data is single cell RNA-seq data and the ml tool uses random forest regression to infer gene regulatory networks. Which is just predicting transcription factor, target gene pairs/edges.

The problem is I am not getting back good metrics. Lots of signs of overfitting. I try getting the r-squared score for the training set and comparing it to the score from the test set and consistently every target gene is giving back much better training scores than test scores. 

My professor just wants to see me give him a final submission ready paper which I just did Friday. But in that paper, and I let him know also, that I explain that the results are not reliable due to the metrics. I also talk about what I can improve on, to try and get better evaluation metrics. The professor knows that the evaluation metrics have not been good so far and is still asking for a submission ready paper, which I have just provided.

My question to you all is: am I allowed to submit a paper where I know that the results aren't reliable,  even if I mention that in the paper? Is this looked down upon in the research community? I believe that this is definitely better than faking the evaluation metrics and data and passing my work off as reliable, much like some other academics at universities have done resulting in a recall of many papers.

I've just published my second blog post analyzing an interesting new paper: [T-FREE: Tokenizer-Free Generative LLMs via Sparse Representations for Memory-Efficient Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19223). You can check out my full breakdown [here](https://f14-bertolotti.github.io/posts/06-09-24-tfree/index.html).

# The Encoding Phase

The authors present an interesting method to reduce the vocabulary size of the embedding matrix using a technique similar to locality sensitive hashing. Here's a breakdown of their process:

1. Apply a whitespace tokenizer to split sentences into words: `""hello world !"" -> [""hello"", ""world"", ""!""]`
2. Add special characters to word boundaries: `[""hello"", ""world"", ""!""] -> [""_hello_"", ""_world_"", ""_!_""]`
3. Split words into 3-grams: `[""_hello_"", ""_world_"", ""_!_""] -> [""_he"", ""hel"", ""ell"", ""llo"", ""lo_"", ""_wo"", ""wor"", ""orl"", ""rld"", ""ld_"", ""_!_""]`
4. Hash each 3-gram into multiple embedding matrix indices: `_hel -> [hash1(""_he"") % v, hash2(""_he"") % v, hash3(""_he"") % v]` (where `v` is the chosen vocabulary size)
5. Create word embeddings by summing all trigram embeddings within each word.

I've created a visual representation of this process: 

https://preview.redd.it/hmvh7lwy42od1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14b4105c048b5ef019a3de06478aa5bb1beeb14

They also propose a decoding phase but it is a bit more convoluted. If you are interested you can check it on my \[post\](https://f14-bertolotti.github.io/posts/06-09-24-tfree/index.html) or on their \[paper\](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19223).

# Key Takeaways and Considerations

1. The paper presents a compelling idea and is generally well-written, though the decoding section could benefit from more detail.
2. The decoding phase applies two different normalizations (division by sum followed by softmax), which seems unconventional.
3. While marketed as tokenizer-free, the method still employs a whitespace tokenizer. ""Training-free tokenizer"" might be more appropriate.
4. An interesting experiment would be to use a standard decoding phase with the full word-embedding matrix. While computationally intensive, I think it could be an interesting experiment.

I'm a professional photographer and I trained a Flux Lora based on my photographic style: [Herbst Photo Style](https://civitai.com/models/691668/herbst-photo-style-moody-candid-analog-35mm-dataset-flux)

There's something that feels right about open sourcing a slice of my own style. It's like reverse gatekeeping.

**About the Lora**

Tags to include in the prompt: herbstphoto, herbst photo

All the images in the training data are analog 35mm film from various stocks, new and expired. I own the rights to all the images. The v2 dataset was small but tagged by hand and greatly outperformed the larger dataset v1.

The model was trained with captions on the following phrases and responds to them well in the prompt: off center, asymmetrical, backlight, light leaks, grainy, grain, film grain, candid, high contrast, film burn, analog texture, partial silhouette, chiaroscuro, highlight bloom, cinema film color, filmic glow, blown out highlights, moody, light sliver, dutch angle, flash photography.

**\*\*\*Recommended Settings\*\*\***

**Lora strength & Flux guidance.**

**2.0 is the sweet spot when paired with a Flux guidance of 2.5.** This results in the lora having a high strength, giving a balanced amount of imperfections and increasing the tonal difference between shadows and higlights.

* .9 is the sweet spot when paired a Flux guidance of 2.0. This results in the lora having a lower strength.
* 3.0 strength and 4.0 guidance produceces better candid moments, flash photo graphy, and film burns.
* 3.5 srength and 5.0 guidance produces more abstract images, with blown out highlights and motion blur, while still remaing tasteful

For the strength 0.5 being is the lowest amount to see effects, and 1.5 is the highest without serious changes to the output. After 1.5 the results are usually more distorted and softer but still tasteful. After 2.0 is diminishing returns.

*\*This version was trained to be quite strong and does not pair well with other loras unless used at it's lowest strength of .9 with a flux guidance of 2.0*

I'm not sure why it helps to increase the flux guidance to a ratio of increments of 2:1 to the lora strength. If anyone could elaborate on this concept I would appreciate it.

**Scheduler & Sampler**

**huen & simple** - standard baseline

unipc\_bh2 & Simple - standard baseline, similar to huen & simple

unipc\_bh2 & normal - gives the highest texture by adding contrast and sharpness in the mid tones

unipc\_bh2 & ddim\_uniform - gives more degredation but tends to alter the output

dpm\_fast & sgm\_uninform - heavy motion blur and texture but tends to alter the output

**Max Shift: 0.0**

**Base Shift: 8.0** is the sweet spot for 35mm grain texture, 4.0 is a lighter grain, 1.0 is the lightest.

If upscaling, use the SD ultimate upscaler:

Model: 4x\_NMKD-Siax\_200k model.

Steps:

CFG 2

Sampler: Euler

Scheduler: Normal

Denoise .2

Length - Match to (upscale amount x original resolution)

Height - Match to (upscale amount x original resolution)

It's been a few months since gpt-4o came out and I have yet to find an equivalent open weights model. Gemini came out even before it and it had multimodal inputs. 

By equivalent, I mean a model that is early fusion and multimodal where vision and audio is tokenized and share the same embedding space as text tokens. I don't necessarily mean it has to have the same capabilities or accuracy. 

As far as I know Meta's chameleon is the closest match but it's bimodal (no audio support) and it can only generate text.

So my question is: is there a truly multimodal model that we can download and tun locally?

[https://github.com/abhimanyupallavisudhir/costly](https://github.com/abhimanyupallavisudhir/costly)

Just put `@costly()` on the load-bearing function (e.g. the API call wrapper itself); make sure all functions that call it pass `**kwargs` (or at least `cost_log` and `simulate`) to it and call your complex function with `simulate=True` and some `cost_log: Costlog` object.

    pip install costly

AFAIK existing packages like `tokencost` are just price dictionaries for estimating the costs of single LLM calls and you have to write your own logic to estimate the cost of your logic. The point of `costly` is to do that for you (and you could use it for other purposes besides LLM calling, though you would need to write your own estimators and simulators).

Obviously there is some non-trivial logic that goes on in pipelines where the output of one LLM is passed to another LLM, etc. -- this logic is approximated by the ""simulator"", which can be subclassed.

I’ve tried using chain-of-thought reasoning in the prompts and even made a resource that compares common shapes, but the results are still not even close. I’m wondering if there are prompt-time strategies or techniques I could try to guide the LLM to better recreate patterns with P5.js shapes and algorithms.

Messing around with classifying MNIST using a basic feed forward neural net at the top, and then the same thing represented by a rank 4 DoRa and then a LoRa, and finally a rank 16 bitnet/dora hybrid with 1 bit per parameter. Getting down to around 0.05 bits per weight. All have the same effective weight count but reduced trainable parameters. It seems like for full weight training, DoRa offers no advantage over LoRa after like 12 epochs.

I'm going to explore whether we can get the same or better performance when increasing the parameter count to match the memory footprint of a normal model. And also summing LoRas and DoRas to dynamically increase rank and prevent early stagnation. My goal is to eventually train a useful LLM on consumer grade hardware.

When removed the examples, that are examples and thus not mandatory for a system to be identified as ""AI"", the definition sounds like this:

>‘AI system’ means a machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs.

Now, this definition could include *any* software developed since the first year's university course of basic programming.

  
To start the discussion, I note the following:

* ""infer"" may refer to a statistical domain, but it would be limited. Moreover the word ""infer"" is not ""statistically infer"": the latter is connected with uncertainty, confidence, etc, while the former is a method of reasoning (from Merriam-Webster Dictionary: ""to derive as a conclusion from facts or premises"").
* The word ""how"" is also wrong: most AI systems don't decide *how* to generate output, they don't modify the algorithm while running.
* ""Varying levels of autonomy"" doesn't set a minimum level: what's the minimum autonomy needed by an AI system?

Please don't say ""laws must be interpreted by judges"". In the EU, we have Civil Law, not Common Law. Laws are still interpreted by judges, but they must be defined in a way that is as little interpretable as possible.

I'm working on a project and could use some guidance on the best way to approach it.

The goal is to build a service that can scan financial documents and classify them into one of several categories. For simplicity, let’s assume there are four categories: Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice, Receipt, and Quotation.

I'm considering two different approaches to solve this problem, and I'd love to get your input on which direction might be more effective, or if there's a third option I should consider.

### Approach 1: Classical ML
One route I’m considering is the traditional machine learning approach. This would involve:

- **OCR**: Extract the text from the document.
- **ML Model**: Train a classifier (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or a neural network) to categorize the document based on the extracted text.

However, since the textual differences between categories like sales and purchase invoices are minimal, I’m also thinking of incorporating some form of **computer vision**. The document’s layout might offer additional clues (e.g., headers, footers, or table structures).

### Approach 2: Generative AI (LLM + Multimodal)
The second option involves leveraging **multimodal large language models (LLMs)** to classify the documents. Here’s how I envision it working:

- In the **prompt**, I would teach the LLM about both the textual and visual distinctions between the categories.
- Additionally, I could employ a **tree-of-thought** or **ensemble** approach, querying multiple LLMs (say, 5-10) with the same document and aggregating their responses for a more deterministic final result.

### Open Questions:
- Which approach would you recommend? 
- Are there specific technologies or frameworks that work best for document classification, particularly for this type of financial data?
- Any thoughts on the feasibility of combining elements of both approaches?

I'm working on a project where I need to inpaint people out of live streams and webcam footage in real-time. I can use Mediapipe's selfie segmentation to identify and mask people at runtime, replacing them with a clean plate from the scene. This approach works great, achieving nearly 30-40fps even on mobile devices. However, it has significant downsides: it requires a clean plate and a static camera.

I also went around and tried to find some alternatives like MI-GAN from Picsart AI which does image inpainting of Missing pixels that I get from mediapipe mask, as they have experimented on onnx runtime for mobile devices. While it looks promising, their method maxes out at around 7-8 fps on mobile, which isn't ideal for real-time applications.

Are there better solutions or models that could achieve real-time inpainting on mobile devices at a higher frame rate? Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated!

- Modern ml: machine learning using deep neural networks like cnn, rnn. Vaguely speaking using pytorch, tensorflow. 

In classical ml space, orchestrators like airflow, step functions had a role in pipelining data cleaning, feature engineering, training, hyper parameter tuning, cross validation, etc.

In the modern ml space, there seems to be less need for orchestration as frameworks tend to do it as part of the model definition. I might be wrong here as I mostly work in classical ml and started to work in modern ml space. 

Is this a valid observation? Where do you use orchestrators in the training? Do you consider data extraction or preparation like one hot encoding, embedding as steps and orchestrate them?

> Frontier models are already trained on much of the internet. Llama 3, for example, was trained on over 15T tokens. Common Crawl, a dump of much of the internet used for LLM training, is >100T tokens raw, though much of that is spam and duplication (*e.g.*, a relatively simple deduplication leads to 30T tokens, implying Llama 3 would already be using basically all the data). Moreover, for more specific domains like code, there are many fewer tokens still, *e.g.* public github repos are estimated to be in low trillions of tokens.",False,False,MachineLearning,[D] Can AI scaling continue through 2030?,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1facftg/d_can_ai_scaling_continue_through_2030/

I am creating this post to get your opinion on two main uncertainty quantification paradigms. I have seen a great rivalry between researchers representing them. I have done research on approximate reference (and Bayesian Deep Learning) but beyond a basic tutorial on CP,  I am not very familiar with CP. My personal opinion is that both of them are useful tools and could perhaps be employed complementary:

CP can provide guarantees but are poshoc methods, while BDLs can use prior regularization to actually \*improve\* model's generalization during training. Moreover, CP is based on the IID assumption (sorry if this is not universally true, at least that was the assumption in the tutorial), while in BDL inputs are IID only when conditioned on an observation of the parameter: in general p(yi,yj|xi,xj)!=p(yi|xi)p(yj|xj) but   p(yi,yj|xi,xj,theta)=p(yi|xi, theta)xp(yj|xj, theta). So BDLs or Gaussian Processes might be more realistic in that regard.

  
Finally, couldn't one derived CP for Bayesian Models? How much the set of predictions provided by CP and those by the Bayesian Model agree in this case? Is there a research paper bridging these approaches and testing this?

  
Apologies in advance if my questions are too basic. I just want to keep an unbiased perspective between the two paradigms.

But two interesting articles have recently come out on the issue that I would like to take as a starting point for the discussion on RAG vs. Long-context LLM.   
  
In summary, if we can put everything in the prompt, we don't need to do retrieval. However I really doubt that we can have a model capable of having a context length that can cover the huge amount of data that any organization has (and without horrendous computational costs).   
  
In any case, there have been unconvincing reports that LC-LLM works better in QA (so far at least I have not read an article that convinced me that LC-LLM works better than RAG). 

 Two articles came out discussing the impact of noise in LLM and RAG: 

* The first states that noise bumps the performance of an LLM and goes to great lengths to characterize this. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13533](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13533)  
* The second one compares RAG and LC-LLMs and shows that by increasing the size of the context, we have a spike (we add relevant chunks) and then performance decreases because LLM has a harder time finding the correct information. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01666)  

  
I think more or less the reason why we will eventually keep RAG, is that LLMs are sophisticated neural networks and therefore pattern recognition machines. In the end, optimizing signal-to-noise is one of the most common (and sometimes difficult) tasks in machine learning. When we start to increase this noise too much eventually the model is bound to start finding noise and get distracted from important information (plus there is also a subtle interplay between the LLM's parametric memory and context, and we still don't know why sometimes ignores the context)

Two, in my personal opinion, there is also a structural reason. self-attention seeks relevant relationships, and under conditions of increased context length, we tend toward a curse of dimensionality in which eventually spurious relationships are accentuated.

I would like to discuss your opinion for what reasons RAG will not be supplanted or if you think LC-LLM will eventually replace it? In the second case, how can it solve the problem of a huge amount of contextually irrelevant data?

For those that don't understand LIFs, they work by integrating a value into the potential and subtracting a leak, then comparing it to a threshold; if it exceeds it, the neuron fires a boolean ""true"" and resets the potential (sometimes a refractory period is implemented, but it's not necessary), else, it fires a ""false"" and keeps the potential.

* Compute and Storage Efficiency: SNNs perform addition and subtraction operations. In other network architectures, floats are normally used because you multiply and add, because of the firing's boolean state, you can simplify the input current to sum the weights of the spiked neurons, because no multiplication is used, you can also further optimize and ditch floats altogether and use fixed point values. For example, if you wanted to store the weight 15.2 into an 8-bit integer with a scaling factor of 10; you would store 152. This does not change anything since *(10+10)/10 = 1+1.*

Another thing I'd like to discuss is why (at least in my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong) AI models, when they need to be retrained to be larger (think GPT) get re-trained from scratch instead of adding more nodes-per-layer/layers into the model initialized with random parameters while keeping the other parameters intact to preserve the past training, then re-training with the modified architecture. Doesn't this shrink the amount of training epochs needed since you already have most of the things figured out? Or is there some reason why they don't do this that I'm unaware of?
