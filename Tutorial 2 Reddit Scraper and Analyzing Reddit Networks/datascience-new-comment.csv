0,ghostofkilgore,"I'm European and have worked with a few DS from LATAM. Partly my observations, partly what I've heard from them, but I'd agree with the general point that LATAM higher education seems to be at a very high level, very comprehensive, and very rigorous. And it produces people with a very solid academic and theoretical background. I have worked with some LATAM DS who were definitely more on the ""more academic, less pragmatic"" end of the spectrum. But I've also worked with others who were the opposite. And plenty of Europeans and other slant more academic as well.

I've worked with people from Europe, LATAM, US, and Asia. To be honest, I haven't noticed any huge differences in capability or performance between any of these groups. There are obviously cultural differences that sometimes come through, but in my anecdotal experience, I wouldn't put any of these groups above or below the others. Individual differences are far greater than group differences.

This is obviously a subset of people who work in Europe, for European companies, so maybe that biases things.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m European and have worked with a few DS from LATAM.

1,aimendezl,"Hey there, I'm Chilean living in The Netherlands. I had so many fears when i came here because i considered Europe/NA to be more advanced and superior in education and professional aspects. 

One thing I've learn is that the education I received in LATAM was comparable or even deeper than what Europeans get. In my country it takes 5 years to get a professional degree and it's almost the equivalent of a BSc+MSc here (of course this varies depending on what uni you study and what subject. I happened to study physics in one of the best universities in the country). One thing worth mentioning tho is that Europeans often start working very earlier in their careers and doing internships and stuff like that. This was something new to me. So despite having a shorter education and not very in depth compare to LATAM, they get a lot of work experience and I'd say that is sometimes even more valuable than knowing lots of theoretical stuff.

Saying that, I notice lots of LATAM people over prepare and become very skillful professionals precisely because of that mentality of thinking we are below European level so we want to get to their level. 

When it comes to companies, they might be bigger if you are in the big cities. However big companies are not synonym of big projects or being super technical. I've worked with big European companies that still work with a bunch of Excel sheets and refuse to modernize.","<div class=""md""><p>Hey there, I&#39;m Chilean living in The Netherlands.

Many years ago I used to frequent a wine retailer.  It was a small shop with two people FT and it operated in a small town. They did a huge number of things right.  The distribution of options was good.  The interaction with a new customer was good.

The bulk of the shop's profit is their VIPs.  There is a relatively small number of people living there who have significant wealth and are quite happy to drop $1,000 on a case of wine.  The shop has an invitation-only club where these people will typically buy a case each, every month.

Track those people back through the journey they went on to become VIPs and you'll see the shop gradually making them feel more welcome as they get to know the person and validate they get on.  
Those that don't fit so well are still welcomed of course.  There's just no push for the next step.  You don't invite the guy on a middle income to your vintage champagne tasting because even if he loves it, he'd only buy a single bottle.

The whole thing works because the staff have incredible memories.  They'll ask after family, and how I found that particular wine I bought last time.  They'll order in wine they think I will like so it's sitting on the shelf when I go back, or if I was more special it might be sitting out back where it wouldn't accidentally sell to the wrong customer.

Most of what I've done in DS over my career has been replicating at scale what that little wine shop could do due to being so small that a person could track it.  

Did they do path analysis?  Absolutely.  Did they do it using statistics? No.   They did it by talking about a customer and thinking what the logical next step for that customer would be.  Then the next customer, and so on.  

The shop would give you a discount to get you to try something.  Because if you like it then you will buy it again and again at full price.  They wouldn't give you that discount if they didn't think you had the interest and the means to regularly pay full price.

In tech, early success with a product is a really good signal for finding value.  Facebook's 3 friends in 5 days is an example of that (seeing what the value of the platform is).  At my old company, we began to experiment with something like this, but it was still early days.  Its why so many platforms try to give you a tour, or give you call to actions to try new features.  They want you to find value, because if you find value then there is a good chance you stick around and give the platform money!

You're right when you say "" someone doing it naturally is different compared to if you were pushed artificially to do something"" -- just because I give you 3 friends on day 3 does not mean you will become a daily active user on facebook.  Rather, the treatment -- a coupon, a call to action, etc -- is intended to remove friction or encourage users to try to perform an action IN ORDER TO POSSIBLY FIND VALUE.

This is why experimentation and measurement are so important.  estimating the average treatment effect on the untreated with probably over state the effect of the intervention -- mostly because the intervention is novel, and the ""treatment"" in whatever causal analysis you do is not the same as removing friction to the treatment.

I think a really good example of this is ""The Free Trial"".  A trial is itself a means of allowing users to discover value, but during the trial you can look to see what features the users interacted with.  In short you can:

* Look at the time period during the trial
* Construct features on what users interacted with, how many times, what calls to action they saw, etc.
* Look at the next 30/60/90/whatever days and determine who got some outcome (e.g. paid for a subscription).
* You can then correlate the features with the outcome via a regression model.  You could even use causal inference to estimate the ATT/ATC/ATE/Whatever estimand

That allows you to make hypotheses like ""Users who interact in this way were X% more likely to pay us"".  Then, can validate that by looking at other cohorts, running experiments, etc.  You test/refine/retest the hypothesis until it is this crystallized piece of knowledge or rule of thumb like the facebook example.

<li>You can then correlate the features with the outcome via a regression model.  You could even use causal inference to estimate the ATT/ATC/ATE/Whatever estimand</li>
</ul>

<p>That allows you to make hypotheses like &quot;Users who interact in this way were X% more likely to pay us&quot;.  Then, can validate that by looking at other cohorts, running experiments, etc.  You test/refine/retest the hypothesis until it is this crystallized piece of knowledge or rule of thumb like the facebook example.</p>

<p>Now, this is HARD to do right, and it takes a lot of time.  But this is how I would approach the problem.</p>

As far as means and reporting numbers to the business goes, here is some extra info to consider:

The arithmetic mean of arithmetic means is only guaranteed to be the same as the overall mean when the sample sizes within groups are the same. So the two ways of aggregating results have different underlying meanings when sample size is different.

In general, a mean is just a way to represent something about a bunch of objects with a single number. There are different types of means. For examples of different means, you can look up harmonic and geometric means.

In a business context, I'd argue if you are reporting any metric, make sure you understand what it is you're saying with that number and consider how a non-technical person will interpret the result.

294,DubGrips,"Every tech company I have worked for has a strict policy around providing feedback to avoid litigation. I have been part of an interview panel where the Recruiter did provide incomplete feedback to the candidate and the candidate brought forth a lawsuit. It was dismissed pretty quickly as it was very easy to demonstrate that the candidate had serious technical gaps relative to the duties of the position, which they were aware of.

It's easier to avoid controversy by being vague. I hate it when I am the candidate, but just recently I passed on a candidate because they were kind of an asshole honestly and they have been harassing my LinkedIn page for a month. I've had to pass on candidates who were not assholes, but were wayyyyy overqualified for the position and they have emailed me several times following up and I can't tell them ""Hey I passed on you because you are too smart for this role and it is obvious that you would get bored and leave in 6 months and leave me severely screwed"". People get aggressive and weird and its easier to just avoid it altogether.","<div class=""md""><p>Every tech company I have worked for has a strict policy around providing feedback to avoid litigation.
