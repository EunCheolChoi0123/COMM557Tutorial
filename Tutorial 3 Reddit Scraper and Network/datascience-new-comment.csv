The exact university/college you get the degree from is less important than the overall quality of the education and the school's department. Plenty of small schools with good departments. Another factor though is network quality. Ideally a school with a large network of alumni that work at high quality jobs makes **you** getting a job easier.

All the above is not to say that you cannot break into the field. The job market is bonkers at the moment and 200+ applications might even be too few (years ago, that sentence would be crazy to write).

There's a few things you should consider:

* How is the quality of your current resume?
   * Feel free to post an anonymized version here on Reddit.
* Who is in your school's alumni network that you can reach out to?
   * Who is not in your school's alumni network that you can reach out to?
* If your work experience is deficient, how can you mitigate these deficiencies?
   * Certificates of completion don't matter. Professional Cloud Certifications can matter for the right companies (i.e. consulting firms that want Data Science professionals to work with clients in the Cloud).
   * Volunteering is not ideal, but real world volunteer projects can help. Open source contributions are one way.

An MS, or PhD in a computational/statistical science can prepare you for a role in DS forward jobs better than a CS or DS major in some ways, depending.

You can also do the same with a BS in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, etc.

Since you're a freshman, one way to figure out which direction you want to go is to focus on general education requirement courses that cover these areas of Engineering, Mathematics, and Data Science. Journal which aspects of each that you like and dislike. By the end of Freshman year, you'll have a much better idea of which Majors and Minors you want to declare for the rest of college.

My main sense is that you want too much out of a role at once. You mention a small team with a lot of autonomy and room for growth, which can be amazing for actually building skills leading others, self starting in ambiguous environments, and working through implementation problems. Your boss might not be technical but they have convinced someone to give them enough budget to let your team operate in a way most teams cannot.

You mention less technical growth in your current role but being pigeonholed in your next. You have to decide how much to focus on one area, but very late career full stack DS are really rare.

1. The change on its own will lead to things, and the insurer is never going to take you anywhere. 

2. AI is more employable than ML, and you won't forget the fundamentals. Go with the industry wave.

3. The client-heavy consulting stuff, is the soft-skills that won't be automated. You might be grinding it out, but at the same time, in a start up, there is so much change happening that you will be thrown new things all the time. This will support your growth.

4. Only do it if you'll move to London. Data salaries there are banging, and there are lots of £150K + jobs.

5. If you help them succeed, the stock isn't worthless, and the experience is highly valued by other startups.

I reckon do that, focus on more full-stack ML and AI integration - learn some Typescript and Rust, and you'll be absolutely bees knees in like 2 years.

I strongly recommend this than sitting with the insurer - that, despite what I imagine is a lot of market share, will gradually become redundant over the next 5-10 years through startups using AI to replace traditional human underwriting with automatic, on-the-spot assessment.

I guess the new job is nearly perfect except for the amount of travel time and the startup risk. If either of those was a none issue I would have accepted it by now.",1,/r/datascience/comments/1na6x3q/help_me_evaluate_a_new_job_offer_stay_or_go/ncs6eul/,True,datascience

I guess ultimately in my current role I feel the ultimate success or failure of my work is outside of my control. Similarly I feel that my growth is hampered by being the most senior technical voice in most conversations, which feels risky at this stage of my career. I guess the new role only solves one of those problems whilst creating many others. 

I will take your suggetoin on board and plot out those paths.

Mainly, they're at the whims of clients' wishes. So you're not neccearily incentivized to build something good. You're incentivized to build something you can get away with convincing someone who has no idea what they're talking about is good. Doesn't sound like my thing.

They also just seem to be a lot more fickle and treat their employees like shit from what I've seen.

I've had a couple of near things in applying at consultancies, and I've always ended up feeling like I dodged a bullet when I heard more about them after.
