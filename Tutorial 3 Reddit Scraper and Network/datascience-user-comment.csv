What's your current job? That could possibly affect the ease of your transition. Also, there are people on this sub that can take a glance at your (anonymized) resume if you want some additional review.

Finally, there's one thing that I said below that applies here:

""The job market is bonkers at the moment and 200+ applications might even be too few (years ago, that sentence would be crazy to write).""

But to maximize your chances, you really should refresh your Python knowledge. The ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python"" book and course would be a nice resource for you:

[https://www.statlearning.com/online-courses](https://www.statlearning.com/online-courses)

You've probably read or seen the R version before.

I also recommend this course in which you are expected to deploy a machine learning model in the end:

You don't have to register for it. You can follow along with the published learning material in the GitHub repo.",1,/r/datascience/comments/1nbdtct/weekly_entering_transitioning_thread_08_sep_2025/ndfq047/,t3_1nbdtct

Keep on going to your school's IT Club events. Make some friends while you're there and start building scalable projects together. Or even build your own projects and talk about them with your fellow club members. Get feedback from them, improve the projects, and put that as experience on the resume. It would be even better if the projects are Web or Mobile applications that students at your college can use. That will make your resume look much better.

NerdyMcDataNerd,nd9szg7,datascience,1757428776.0,"College really should be a mix of two things:

1. Academic Interest.
2. Feasibility of getting a good Career.

Ideally, you want to find a balance between the two but **NEVER** sacrifice the second. You can certainly get a great job doing analysis, modeling, and simulation with a BS in Data Science. You can also do the same with a BS in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, etc.

Since you're a freshman, one way to figure out which direction you want to go is to focus on general education requirement courses that cover these areas of Engineering, Mathematics, and Data Science. Journal which aspects of each that you like and dislike. By the end of Freshman year, you'll have a much better idea of which Majors and Minors you want to declare for the rest of college.

You should also be networking with as many Professors (go to Office Hours and email them) and Upper-year students (go to School Club events) as possible.

NerdyMcDataNerd,nd9rp6o,datascience,1757428397.0,"**TLDR;** network and work hard to reduce deficiencies on your resume. Keep applying because the job market is kinda cooked.

>bachelor's from a small non-STEM school pretty much never going to cut it on its own?

The exact university/college you get the degree from is less important than the overall quality of the education and the school's department. Plenty of small schools with good departments. Another factor though is network quality. Ideally a school with a large network of alumni that work at high quality jobs makes **you** getting a job easier.

All the above is not to say that you cannot break into the field. The job market is bonkers at the moment and 200+ applications might even be too few (years ago, that sentence would be crazy to write).

There's a few things you should consider:

* How is the quality of your current resume?
   * Feel free to post an anonymized version here on Reddit.
* Who is in your school's alumni network that you can reach out to?
   * Who is not in your school's alumni network that you can reach out to?
* If your work experience is deficient, how can you mitigate these deficiencies?
   * Certificates of completion don't matter. Professional Cloud Certifications can matter for the right companies (i.e. consulting firms that want Data Science professionals to work with clients in the Cloud).
   * Volunteering is not ideal, but real world volunteer projects can help. Open source contributions are one way.

Still, I can think of at least two examples where I was brought in crazy early, like the idea for a proposal was still on the back of a napkin and leadership hadn't even signed off and given budget to it. Essentially there is a meeting a week for 2 months before it even gets off the ground that I don't need to be a part of, and by the time it might actually require me I honestly don't care anymore.

Although I'm not sure how it gets implemented (in terms of processes, company culture, political capital required, pushback when people don't follow it), the data team needs to be viewed as an equal partner instead of ticket takers or some people who just do what product tells them to do.

1. How do u get your data? Is it streamlined or require some ETLs? If pipelines are required, how do u automate it?

2. If data cleaning is required, are your cleaning scripts reusable next time? Will it break ? Is it modularized and usable by everyone on your team? Can it be automated?

3. If feature engineering is required for a model, do you do it manually or automated? Can the features be used for other similar models? If yes, can we store it somewhere?

4. As for model training and optimizations - can it be an offline job? No one is going to stare at the notebook locally and have it run overnight.

5. How do u know if your latest model is better than your previous ones? Can we consider a Champion vs Challenger workflow? Can we have some BI tools to log all these metrics (Loss/ROC/Accuracy etc) ?

6. Can we have some sort of alert systems notifying the team if trainings pipelines failed or succeed ?

7. Who is using the latest model? Internal or external parties? How should you deliver  model predictions - will it be an offline job with an excel file or the users will talk with your model via an API?

8. If an API is required, what tools, language and framework will you use and how do you update your model checkpoints automatically without interfering production models ?

9. How do you set up version controls in case a roll back is required (both model checkpoints and codebases) 

Speaking strictly with GCP tools, all the questions mentioned above can be tackled with Airflow, Docker, Cicd, Cloud Run, PubSub, MFflow, Looker, Power Bi, BigQuery, Vertex Ai, KubeFlow Pipelines",36,/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1kzx4fk/whats_the_difference_between_working_on/mv9l6fc/,t3_1kzx4fk

Here are some scenarios where I've found a Bayesian approach preferable over a Frequentist approach. 

* It can be really useful to have a full (posterior) distribution for your parameter estimates. You can make probability statements like ""there is a 90% chance this treatment is effective"" or ""there's an 70% chance this coin is not fair"". 
* Bayesian statistics is great for missing data problems. In Bayesian methods, you can assume a distribution for your missing data and get a full posterior distribution for all your missing data. It turns your missing data into something tangible. 
* You can have a hard time building a very bespoke model in a Frequentist setting. Let's say you're doing multilevel regression with Laplace errors. I would have no idea how to fit a Frequentist version of that model, but it's easy to throw that into Stan and get something out.

In reality they're not able to set up reliable tests and go deep on the analysis because they're not trained that way which isn't their fault. 

I feel like I'd need to be very hands on to get the level of analysis needed to properly assess how users interact with our features but perhaps I'm also being too ambitious in my expectations?

I get the sense that in order to survive medical school, you need to have some intense intrinsic (or extrinsic, I understand many people go to med school because of pressure from family) motivations that I don't see that you have, since you seem kind of lukewarm about it.

I understand the draw to stability - it seems like becoming a doctor is probably one of the most stable careers, but I'm not sure the promise of stability alone can get you through what is certain to be a grueling 10+ years. I want to also say that I think that there is uncertainty in most lines of work, not just tech, but it's something that you can learn to deal with. Who knows what tech is going to look like in ten years, but federal workers in the US probably didn't anticipate how unstable their jobs have become especially since government jobs are often thought of as being incredibly stable. At least with tech you learn how to be consistently teaching yourself new tools and hopefully can be prepared to adjust with the changing AI hellscape. 

You can also keep doing your job but potentially for an organization whose mission aligns more with your values (you like hiking and being outdoors for example, can you move to software engineering for some kind of climate tech org or non-profit)?

peterxsyd,ndequ7k,edmproduction,1757490162.0,"To help answer this - I tend to have 100+ tracks in projects. Most of the time, there is very little on a lot of them, and the core track is on 20-30 tracks. However, examples of what goes on the other tracks is:

*  Ambient sounds, to add a sense of space and randomness
*  Layers - to strengthen sounds that do not cover enough of the frequency spectrum
* Duplicated and slightly de-tuned, and/or transposed version of the same track - for the same reason (often up to 4x).
* Bounced FX - where I want to control the reverb tail, chop it up, etc. etc. - also hyper processed versions of a track, maybe even low in the mix or similar.
* Glitches
* Drums - a big one. Lots of little, often quiet drums.

  
This is for Anjunadeep-like progressive house.

The end result is that the track, sounds more textured, a little more interesting, and basically the little bits of randomness and layers add weight to the track. 

The downside is that it then becomes harder to mix. Many professional tracks use 20-30 tracks and then they hyper optimise their space within the track, and the result is a clean, fat sound. So it is definitely not a requirement to use more, and if the underlying musical idea is interesting, sometimes there is less need to add more interest.

My main sense is that you want too much out of a role at once. You mention a small team with a lot of autonomy and room for growth, which can be amazing for actually building skills leading others, self starting in ambiguous environments, and working through implementation problems. Your boss might not be technical but they have convinced someone to give them enough budget to let your team operate in a way most teams cannot.

You mention less technical growth in your current role but being pigeonholed in your next. You have to decide how much to focus on one area, but very late career full stack DS are really rare. People usually find a technical niche, move into management or leadership, or dramatically pivot into something else. I sort of am one of these types and I've had to decide to jump fully into Causal Inference and Experimentation after realizing I hated the engineering side of production ML projects.

We were recruiting for a Staff level position last year and had 5-6 total dud candidates then one that was awesome. Super technical, but able to clearly distill complex methods blah blah blah. Resounding ""yes"" vote from everyone minus our Director. The reason why? Another team had interviewed a candidate for a research oriented position and they liked her, but she didn't have quite the technical depth. They felt that somehow she would be a better fit and the Director overrode our decision. It sucked because that hire wasn't as strong as the person we rejected and hasn't made much impact.

Honestly you dodged a bullet. Despite the name Meta doesn't produce better Data Scientists than anywhere else.
