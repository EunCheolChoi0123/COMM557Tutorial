I’m stuck on LeetCode 21 – Merge Two Sorted Lists and I don’t just want a solution — I really want to understand what’s going on under the hood.

I know the problem says:

Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list and return its head.

But here’s where I get confused:
	•	How does a “linked list” actually work compared to an array?
	•	What does ListNode(val, next) really store in memory?
	•	How do we “merge” these lists step by step — like what happens first, then next, etc.?
	•	Why do people always create a “dummy node” and then return dummy.next?
	•	And why does curr.next = list1 attach the node — what is actually happening in memory?

If someone could break this down step by step with an example like list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4], and maybe even draw a quick diagram or explain it visually, that would help me so much.

I don’t need code (I can write that after I understand). I just need a clear mental model of what’s happening behind the scenes.

Thanks! 🙏

I am struggling to find a way to use pywin32 or a similar library to open the pptx, wait for it to load the slide getting data from PowerBI, reset and apply a new filter (In the PowerPoint UI you can Reset and select the new filter from a toolbar at the bottom of the slide -> Data options). It seems like an easy task but I could only find a solution with PyAutoGUI but this makes it more rudimentary and the need to act on the UI also blocks the user from performing other tasks while its running.

I did this Collatz Sequence, with exception handling. As you can see, I do the exception handling in a while loop first, then another while loop afterwards with the sequencing part. Is there a way to nest one inside the other? 

If nesting is useless to do,  and it's ok  to keep them separate, that's fine too. But could someone explain an example case (if there is one) where we'd want to nest while loops?

  
(Sorry if my formatting is bad; I just copied and pasted the code):

  
`def collatz(number):`

`if number % 2 == 0: # definition of even number`

`return number // 2 # floor division: how many times does 2 go into the number`

`if number % 2 != 0: # odd number`

`return 3 * number + 1`

`while True: #not sure how to nest this within the other while loop`

`try:`

`number = int(input ('Give a number (integer): '))`

`isItOne = collatz(number) # this will give the first return value`

`break`

`except ValueError:`

`print ('please give an integer')`



`num = 0`

`while True:` 

`num = num + 1 # just to keep count of how many iterations`

`print ('return value number ' + str(num) + ' is: ' + str(isItOne))` 

`if isItOne == 1:`

`print ('Finally!')`  
break

`else:`

`isItOne = collatz (isItOne)`

I have a strong background in Java, C++, and C#. I took up a little web scraping project for work and I'm using it as a way to better my understanding of the language. I've just carried over my knowledge from languages I know how to use and tried to apply it here, but I think I am starting to run into something of a language barrier and need some help.

The program I'm writing is being used to take product data from a predetermined list of retailers and add it to my company's catalogue. We have affiliations with all the companies being scraped, and they have given us permission to gather the products in this way.

The program I have written relies on requests-html and bs4 to do the following

* Request the html at a predetermined list of retailer URLs (all get requests happen concurrently)
* Render the pages (every page in the list relies on JS to render)
* Find links to the products on each retailer's page
* Request the html for each product (concurrently)
* Render each product's html
* Store and manipulate the data from the product pages (product names, prices, etc)

I chose requests-html because of its async features as well as its ability to render JS. I didn't think full page interaction from something like Selenium was necessary, but I needed more capability than what was provided by the requests package. On top of that, using a browser is sort of necessary to get around bot checks on these sites (even though we have permission to be scraping, the retailers aren't going to bend over backwards to make it easier on us, so a workaround seemed most convenient).

For some reason, my AsyncHTMLSession.arender calls are super unreliable. Sometimes, after awaiting the render, the product page still isnt rendered (despite the lack of timeout or error). The html file yielded by the render is the same as the one yielded by the get request. Sometimes, I am given an html file that just has 'Please wait 0.25 seconds before trying again' in the body. 

I also (far less frequently) encounter this issue when getting the product links from the retailer pages. I figure both issues are being caused by the same thing

My fix for this was to just recursively await the coroutine (not sure if this is proper terminology for this use case in python, please forgive me if it isn't) using the same parameters if the page fails to render before I can scrape it. Naturally though, awaiting the same render over and over again can get pretty slow for hundreds of products even when working asynchronously. I even implemented a totally sequential solution (using the same AsyncHTMLSession) as a benchmark (which happened to not run into this rendering error at all) that outperformed the asynchronous solution.

My leading theory about the source of the problem is that Chromium is being abused by the amount of renders and requests I'm sending concurrently - this would explain why the sequential solution didn't encounter the same error. With that being said, I run into this problem for so little as one retailer URL hosting five or less products. This async solution would have to be terrible if that was the standard for this package.

Below is my implementation for getting, rendering, and processing the product pages:

    async def retrieve_auction_data_for(_auction, index):
        logger.info(f""Retrieving auction {index}"")
        r = await session.get(url=_auction.url, headers=headers)
        async with aiofiles.open(f'./HTML_DUMPS/{index}_html_pre_render.html', 'w') as file:
            await file.write(r.html.html)
        await r.html.arender(retries=100, wait=2, sleep=1, timeout=20)
    
        #TODO stabilize whatever is going on here. Why is this so unstable? Sometimes it works
        soup = BeautifulSoup(r.html.html, 'lxml')

I believe to become a better engineer I should solidify my toolset and Python looks excellent to me as it lies on the boundary between backend engineering and AI

why fluent python: As I mentioned I already have some background in python, I wrote scripts, debugged application codes but I didn’t got chance to explore actual python yet. I’m excited about it’s internals, memory management and design philosophy. After searching on web and brainstorming with chatgpt, concluded that fluent python is the best thing to follow at this point

my plan: I’ve decided to go through the book cover to cover, as a textbook. Will try to do as much hands on as possible and also try to make small projects along the way. I’m keeping the rough deadline of 90 days to complete the book

If I understand correctly, each instance of a class is only created after it passes __init__ method defined for that class. 

So if I need to create 5 rabbit instances of class Rabbit, it can be through a loop under Rabbit class which goes through __init__ 5 times?

tl;dr: while loops including `print()` crash python instead of looping normally

not sure how to explain, but previously, on different computers and probably this one too (don't remember) when I would do something like

    while 1:
        print('hi')

it would print hi over and over in the shell until i killed the program, but now it just straight up crashes python and i have to force quit the program.

does anyone know why? this is really annoying because I want to loop through about 6000 items and print them in order, but now I can't do that because python just stops responding. the best solution i can come up with is to add time.sleep(), but even then i have to add a frustratingly large number (like 0.05) to keep from crashing. What's more frustrating is this worked fine for a friend, just like it used to for me. I know i'm describing a problem that by nature cannot be replicated, but does anyone know what the problem could be?

technically i solved my problem\*, but not super happy about it. basically, i've used IDLE, the default IDE, since I started learning python on and off in 2020. i've never had any use for any of the features of VSCode or anything similar, and not only that, i couldnt even figure out how to run my code. i rawdog my coding, just a white screen melting my eyes out at 2am, no AI assistant, no auto complete, nothing. I tried using PyCharm and while i can't figure out how to run code that I already wrote, if I start the application fresh and write something new (specifically the snippet offered above), it does actually work. the problem was with my IDE, IDLE. I don't remember updating it so i don't know why it doesn't work like it used to, and I really wish I didn't have to switch to a more complicated IDE, but my problem was technically solved. This might seem obvious but again besides cheating on it a few times (and not even with python) i've never used anything but IDE.

Hey r/LocalLLaMA,

I've been deep in the world of local RAG and wanted to share a project I built, VeritasGraph, that's designed from the ground up for private, on-premise use with tools we all love.

My setup uses Ollama with llama3.1 for generation and nomic-embed-text for embeddings. The whole thing runs on my machine without hitting any external APIs.

The main goal was to solve two big problems:

Multi-Hop Reasoning: Standard vector RAG fails when you need to connect facts from different documents. VeritasGraph builds a knowledge graph to traverse these relationships.

Trust & Verification: It provides full source attribution for every generated statement, so you can see exactly which part of your source documents was used to construct the answer.

One of the key challenges I ran into (and solved) was the default context length in Ollama. I found that the default of 2048 was truncating the context and leading to bad results. The repo includes a Modelfile to build a version of llama3.1 with a 12k context window, which fixed the issue completely.

The project includes:

The full Graph RAG pipeline.

A Gradio UI for an interactive chat experience.

A guide for setting everything up, from installing dependencies to running the indexing process.

GitHub Repo with all the code and instructions: https://github.com/bibinprathap/VeritasGraph

I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts, especially on the local LLM implementation and prompt tuning. I'm sure there are ways to optimize it further.

Keeping track of everything, from variables to how the same data get's manipulated in different functions breaks me. 

If I see the values as print statements and hardcode different ones, okay, I can read. But having projects that only returns data, for me is like a huge wall I can't jump.

Hello, I am a male approaching 30 years of age in a few years. 2 months ago I have been learning coding to work in IT as my career. The first language I have learned is Python. I have a good grasp on all the basics and I've learned up to OOP, Functional Programming and Classes so I would say my skill level is possibly intermediate. I need more practice with these concepts and soon moving on to Data Structures and Algorithms.

I genuinely love coding. I initially picked up coding so I could learn game development but the more I learn, the more things I want to build. I can't really decide what to specialize on. As of the moment, I am learning Full Stack Development. I've learned a good bit of Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS and soon moving on to Javascript.

Here's where I am worried. I have never been to college. There's a lot of negativity on the internet regarding IT work. Massive layoffs, companies not hiring, ghosting, dealing with HR, AI replacing jobs, companies being dismissive for not having a diploma, etc. Do I even have a chance?

I have a wife and three kids. I want a career to provide a better life for them. I can't afford to fail or waste time. I don't want to be 30 years old and have accomplished nothing in life. I want this so badly. I don't have anyone in my family to help me. They all doubt my abilities. I don't know if being self taught is enough. I work 55 hours a day, 6 days a week. And I study in every minute of free time I can. I've been learning on platforms like Mimo, Sololearn, Enki, Boot.dev, and more.

I need direction, a plan, advice, anything. I'm not doing this just for the money though that is a big reason why. I do love this kind of work. This is the only thing I've felt passionate about to where I truly believe I could make a career out of it.

As a newby to Python, I am wondering, when you start a project and need to import packages. How do you decide which packages to import?



I know this is a bit of a vague/open-ended question.

  
I found this link ( [https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=) ) where you can search per topic, which already helps a bit, but then, there are multiple packages that seem to be similar. How do I know which is best?

  
I am getting the hang of the basics, but would like to start testing my knowledge with little projects. So feel a bit lost with ""analysis paralysis"" on how/which packages to choose. I do not have a project yet, just thought about how to go about choosing packages to import.

  
Do I look for the:

* Most recent updated?
* read through each package description to try and figure out what it does? Some of the things go WAY over my head/current knowledge

You might have seen me before, in which ive asked questions about this passion project of mine, but since then Ive completely reworked the code, and redone it, multiple times, ive added a GUI ive added graphs, and ive tried taking as many suggestions as I can, but I feel like this is a tired horse by now, and I should move on from this, Should I? or should I keep working on this. I feel like I might learn more moving on since Im a beginer, but I do Like this project a bit.

It messes up the transparency and there's a lot of artifacting. I see search results dating back over a decade showing other people with the same issue. Despite that, there's no working fix that I have found. I have gone through the top Stackoverflow results and they either give the same bad output or won't run.

I have also not found any alternative to Pillow. I don't want to develop a deep understanding of this and I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I naively believed that resizing animated gifs with Python was a simple, solved issue. Is there some other Python library that will just take an animated gif and a target size and resize it well, without ruining the image? Or is there some set of code for Pillow that will do it?

I’m still learning Python, and I recently made a package called [DictSQLite](https://github.com/disnana/DictSQLite). It’s also on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dictsqlite), so you can install it directly (`pip install dictsqlite`).

The goal is to make it possible to use SQLite almost like a Python dictionary.

I already know my code is a bit messy and doesn’t follow PEP8 perfectly 😅, but I’d really like feedback on other things such as:

* Features (is the API clear? anything you’d expect to be there?)
* Performance (any obvious slow parts?)

The exact task I’m doing is classifying ground points in a large point cloud file and it’s taking a long time so the GPU processing is important.
First off, while it was running, I will occasionally see a pop up notification saying I have a GPU set up but I’m not using it. How do I get colab to utilize the GPU for the processing? That’s the whole point of why I’m doing this in colab, to use the GPUs for faster processing. Also, I started it around 2pm yesterday and woke up to the runtime deactivated. I thought if a code cell is running, it would count as activity and runtime will not deactivate. I do I extend the runtime duration so it doesn’t deactivate? I have gigabytes of point clouds to process 🥲🥲.

Pls help advise.",5,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1natp1b/how_can_i_ensure_my_code_is_using_the_gpu_in/,False,True,False

I’m pretty new to Python and recently decided to try a small project: making an AI for a 5-choice Rock-Paper-Scissors game. My goal was just to create something that could learn from an opponent’s moves and try to make smarter choices over time. I’ve been testing it by playing against random moves, and honestly, it loses most of the time. I think the logic works, but it’s clearly not very good yet 😅

I’m mainly looking for:

* **Optimization tips** – how can I make this code cleaner or more efficient?
* **Opinions on the strategy** – does this approach seem reasonable for an AI, or is there a smarter way to predict moves?

Since I’m just starting out, any advice, suggestions, or even small improvements would mean a lot! Thanks so much in advance 😊

**note:** I know some of my variable names might be confusing—this is my first project, and I’m used to writing super short, one-letter variables without comments. Sometimes even I struggle to read my own code afterward 😅. I’m working on being more organized and improving readability!

**What My Project Does:** A library that includes several authentication methods out of the box:

* JWT (with black/white lists)
* Serverside sessions (with AES content encryption)
* OTP (TOTP/HOTP)
* OAuth2 in development

**Target Audience:** Developers who write applications on minimalist frameworks without built-in authorization (or with inconvenient out-of-the-box authorization), such as: starlette, flask, strawberry, litestar, aiohttp, and others.

**Comparison / How It’s Different:** Most popular auth\* libraries only provide JWT solutions. In my work, for example, JWT is not suitable because it is not very secure. The project README contains a [small table](https://github.com/lyaguxafrog/jam?tab=readme-ov-file#why-jam) comparing different projects.

**Feedback Questions:**

* Would you like to receive criticism/advice on your project?
* Advice on how to improve the API and user experience?
* What could be added/removed to make the library better?

I work at a network, managing multiple channels. Each day, I need to fill precise time gaps between scheduled content using a set of promo and interstitial trailers.

These trailers have frame-accurate durations (e.g., 00:00:15;04, 00:02:14;17) and are measured using a frame rate of 30 fps. I’m looking to automate the process of selecting promos and interstitials that add up to the time gap between two programs.

**My Goals**

I would like to build a tool (preferably in Excel with Python integration so that I can share it amongst members in my team who are not familiar with code) that can:

\- Convert all promo and interstitial durations from HH:MM:SS;FF format to frame counts.

\- Take a time gap (e.g., 00:03:54;17) and convert it into a target number of frames.

\- Select the best non-repeating combination of promos and interstitials that fits the time gap within a small tolerance (about ±4 seconds ideally).

\- Prefer a structure like promo > interstitial > promo > promo when the gap allows.

\- Flag when the selected combination doesn’t follow the preferred structure or fall within the allowed tolerance range.

\- Return the list of selected promos/interstitials, their order, total frame count, and the difference from the target.

**The Model I Currently Use**

Right now (thanks to the help of folks in this sub a few months ago), I’m using Excel with Solver to select which promos or interstitials to use by assigning a binary value (1 = selected, 0 = not selected). It minimises the gap between the target and the selected number of frames. It constrains the number of each type selected and the number of items. It also includes the ± 4-second gap, expressed as ±119 frames, just as a check to see if the solution is within the range. 

It's practically perfect, with the exception that Solver is so slow it hurts. Especially when I need to fill multiple gaps per day across several channels.

I’ve heard that Python in Excel might offer a better solution, and I do have access to Python in Excel through my work account. I’m looking for help understanding how I might rebuild or improve my model using Python in Excel. I have little to no experience with code -  I'm totally willing to pick up a new skill, so I would do it directly in Python myself, but the end goal would be to share it amongst members of my team who work on different channels, and for that it needs to be super user friendly just have them input what they need and have it give them something to work with.

**The Workflow I’m Trying to Improve**

For each gap between airings, I currently:

\- Add mandatory elements like open cards, navigation bumps, and disclaimers before the top of the show.

\- Use any remaining time between those elements to place promos and interstitials in the correct order.

\- Repeat this process for each airing that day, across multiple channels, for a week ahead.

\- I have promos and interstitials ranging from about 15 seconds to 4 mins 21 secs.

**What I’m Asking For**

\- Can someone help me understand how I might rebuild this model using Python in Excel?

\- What would the logic or structure look like for solving this kind of frame-accurate selection problem

\- Is there a way to make this repeatable across multiple time gaps without needing to re-run it manually each time?

He coded a program that should grade school tests, like a basic OMR scanner. It was compiled into an .exe. The program works like this:  
The answer sheet has 5 columns, 4 with 15 questions and 1 with 5, each of them with 4 options. The program is configured to read data from .jpg images after we scan the sheets.  
We have a .txt file where we type in how many questions on each full column, how many on the last column and the answer key (letters from A to D as usual). The results are output to a .csv.

The guy that coded this left the job before we could put to good use, with real students. We're all teachers here and no one else knows anything about programming - he was a maths teacher but also an engineer.

Now, these are the problems we face:

Any time the program encounters a sheet it cannot read - and I can't seem to identify the reason why it can't, there is no visible or discernible pattern for this, at least for me - it will close because of unhandled exception and the I have to manually edit the .jpg file until it becomes ""readable"". But this was ok.

As of today, there is a new error. The program won't read any scanned sheets, not even the original one used to test it. The error message reads as follows:

>list index out of range

In one instance, it specifies the result should have a .0, but in other inputs, it needs to have a .00. For example, in one input, the result must be 15.4, and it must only have its decimal value in the tenths place; it will not accept it being in the hundredths; yet, there are points where it needs to be, the result must be 23.45, not 23.4, and it confounds me how to proceed with the coding. For now, my script looks like this:

    a = int(input('number: '))
    b = int(input('number: '))
    converted_a = a * x.12 
    converted_b = b * y.34
    sum_of_both_converted_values = converted_a + converted_b
    print(f'The result: {sum_of_both_converted_values}')

It is all well in producing a value that reconciles into a number with a .0, a decimal value in tenths, the code there is all correct, so far as the program is concerned; it's only when it doesn't, there I cannot figure it out, I can't visualize it into something formidable, I can't do:

    print(f'The result: {sum_of_both_converted_values:.2f}')

Since it will effect the entire script, it will force those in tenths-place to be in hundreths-place; So, 1.8, for example, becomes 1.80, which the program doesn't accept, as it requires 1.8 to be 1.8, and not 1.80; There are sum values that, when all of the necessary calculations are processed, i.e., 'sum\_of\_all\_converted\_values', naturally generate with larger place values. There would be products that equal 1.123456..., for example, and that's what annoys me, since I cannot simply 'reclaim' into having just 2 decimal values without affecting the entire ecology of the script. I am sure that there is a way of having 1.8 and 1.12 coexist in the script, but my knowledge of coding and programming is still too limited to form a viable solution. Can anyone help me form a solution?

Also fail to understand why @property needed with def capacity and def size functions. Is it because getter needs to be preceded with @property? But if I am not wrong, getter function also works without @property preceding.

Can you help me with a concrete plan? I’m asking for things like:

* Which one to start with first and why
* Daily / weekly schedule (e.g. Day 1: watch X mins + do Y exercises) — please give exact steps I can copy/paste
* Which exercises to prioritize or skip in the 30-Days repo
* How/when to use Python Tutor (which concepts to step through)
* Which mini-projects from the python-mini-projects repo are best for absolute beginners and in what order
* How long per day you recommend (options for 30 / 60 / 90 min/day)
* Any motivation / focus tips for someone who struggles to keep going",0,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n8nmat/back_to_python_which_order_should_i_follow_with/,False,True,False

I’m searching for a **comprehensive, high-quality course in English** that doesn’t just cover the basics of FastAPI or async/await, but really shows the **transformation of microservices from development to production**.

What I’d love to see in a course:

* Start with **one or multiple async microservices** in Python (ideally FastAPI) that run with **Uvicorn/Gunicorn**(using workers, concurrency, etc.).
* Show how they evolve into **production-ready services**, deployed with Docker, Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, OpenShift, etc.), or cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
* Cover **real production concerns**: CI/CD pipelines, logging, monitoring, observability, autoscaling.
* Include **load testing** to prove concurrency works and see how the service handles heavy traffic.
* Go beyond toy examples — I’m looking for a **qualified, professional-level course** that teaches modern practices for running async Python services at scale.

I’ve seen plenty of beginner tutorials on FastAPI or generic Kubernetes, but nothing that really connects async microservice development (with Uvicorn/Gunicorn workers) to the full story of production deployments in the cloud.

If you’ve taken a course similar to the one Im looking for or know a resource that matches this, please share your recommendations 🙏

It will help to have an explanation of how a new food instance is created on line 20. Unable to follow the logic behind:

        food = cls(ingredients = [ ]) 

I do understand ingredients is an empty list as ingredients are later to be derived. 

Update:

So food = cls(ingredients = [ ])  equivalent to:

        food = Food.from_nothing(ingredients =[ ]) 

Update 2:

As per AI tool, my above update is wrong. It can be:

        food = Food(ingredients = [ ])

How can I make it so that the files work at runtime AND the `proj.foo` ""prefix"" is understood and resolved by Pyright inside VS Code/Cursor?

```tx
~/foo-repo/
├── bar/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── jim.py
│   └── types.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── foo-repo.code-workspace

The above gist shows the setup (assume all `bar-*` files are actually in `bar/` directory, since GitHub Gist doesn't allow a slash in the filename). I want to be able to clone this repo and do…

```sh
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
python bar/jim.py
```

…and have it work. And, I want to be able to open the workspace in Cursor (or VS Code) and have Pyright not complain about `proj.foo.bar` unable to be resolved.

### Motivation

I have a real repo that `foo` is a subtree within:

```txt
~/proj/                <== This is a git repo
├── xxx/
├── src/
│   └── proj/
│       ├── yyy/

│       │   ├── docs/
│       │   └── bar/
│       └── zzz/
└── tests/
```

I want an intern who is not allowed to clone the `proj` repo to be able to clone the `foo` repo and run code in there (as long as it does not attempt to access files outside of ""foo""). Later, I want to be able to sync the intern's work back into the main `proj` repo...so I can't change all `proj.foo` imports to a different namespace, and I don't want to change the hierarchy of all files inside here.

I found (and lost) one way to make it work at runtime, but pyright didn't understand it or honor it. I have a hack working now where I've created dummy `proj/foo` directories inside `foo-repo` and added softlinks to files and directories...but that's messy, so I'm hoping there's a clean way to do this.",2,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n7kwjx/how_to_spoof_a_namespace_without_creating/,False,True,False

     arsenal is a global function, but for some reason, when the arsenal selection loop ends, that is directly what causes the arsenal to be wiped.
    relevant code:
    
    piece 1:
    
    elif movement == ""battle fish"":
                    if great_plains_fish == ""alive"":
                        current_opponent = opponent[""fish (w1p3)""]
                        arsenal = select_arsenal()
                        print(f""debug: {arsenal}"") #this line returns none
                        player[""type""] = get_player_type(arsenal)
                        mode = ""battle""
                        break

    break_arsenal = ""no""
    def select_arsenal():
        global break_arsenal
        if break_arsenal == ""no"":

1n77eig,towerofbagels,1756880868.0,5,/r/learnpython/comments/1n77eig/logging_config_insanity_with_ci/,learnpython,logging config insanity with CI,"Hi r/learnpython, I've recently run into a problem that has stumped me. There are lots of resources online about setting up python logging, but I haven't found any with a good answer for my particular scenario. I'll set the scene:

pydantic settings module, loads from .env and throws an error when `some_required_var` is missing.

     class Settings(BaseSettings):
      model_config = SettingsConfigDict(args...)
      SOME_REQUIRED_VAR: str
      LOG_LEVEL: str = ""INFO""
    
    u/lru_cache
    def get_settings():
      return Settings() # type: ignore

""logger.py"" module. I'll explain further down why I set it up this way:

    import logging
    from app.core.settings import get_settings
    s = get_settings()
    logging.basicConfig(level=s.LOG_LEVEL)
    
    def get_logger(name: str):
      return logging.getogger(name)

""email service"" module. uses the logger

    from app.core.logger import get_logger
    
    log = get_logger(__name__)
    
    class EmailService:
      def example_send():
        log.info(""sent email"")

test\_email\_service.py pytest file:

    from app.email_service import EmailService <<< THIS LINE CAUSES ERROR
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def email_service():
      return EmailService(mock_example_dependencies)

The import line is causing an error when I don't have the `SOME_REQUIRED_VAR` set in a .env file (as is the case in my current CI github workflow, because the var is completely unrelated to the tests I have written, because get\_logger is in  [`logger.py`](http://logger.py), which in turn makes a call to `get_settings`.

The error:

    ERROR collecting tests/test_email_service.py
    tests/test_email_service.py:12:in <module>
      from app.email_service import EmailService
    app/email_service.py:16 in <module>
      from app.core.logger import get_logger
    app/core/logger.py:5: in <module>
      settings = get_settings()
    
    ...blablabla...
    E  pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation errors for Settings
    E  SOME_REQUIRED_VAR
    E    Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]

My question is, how do I set the log level using settings (which has unrelated required variables) while also ensuring that the basicConfig is shared across all files that need a logger? When I had the logger.basicConfig in my [`main.py`](http://main.py)`, I had the following issue:`

    # app/main.py
    from app.core.settings import get_settings
    import logging
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from app.redis import setup_redis <<< IMPORT REDIS FILE, WHICH USES LOGGING
    
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def lifespan(app):
      app.state.redis_client = setup_redis()
      yield
      app.state.redis_client.close()
    
    settings = get_settings()
    
    logging.basicConfig(level=settings.LOG_LEVEL)
    app = FastAPI(""my_app"")

I wanted to use the logger (with appropriate log level) within the redis file, but importing it caused its logger to be created before the logging config had been registered, meaning my logs in the redis file were in the wrong format.

    # redis.py
    settings = get_settings()
    log = get_logger(__name__)
    
    def setup_redis():
      redis_client = Redis.from_url(...)
      log.info(""logging something here"") <<< DOES NOT USE LOGGING CONFIG FROM MAIN

Am I going about this all wrong? should I just be mocking or patching the settings loading in my tests, should I be creating loggers on demand within service functions and so on? I can't seem to find a straight answer elsewhere online and would really appreciate some input, thank you so much",2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n77eig/logging_config_insanity_with_ci/,False,True,False

I am a data engineering mostly utilizing Python for various ETL tasks using notebooks. I would consider myself a advanced beginner. I have a decent understanding of the language and get the things done I need to get done. Still I would like to become more proficient, write better code and better utilize the variety of option Python as a language has to offer.

Things I am looking for

\- best practices on how to write and structure code

\- writing modules/classes: Using notebooks this has not been my biggest focus yet, so I definitely need to catch up here

\- error handling

\- testing

This is not supposed to be a complete list, just the things that intrigue me from the top of my head

    def hello(name):
        print(f""Hello {name}"")

    def hi(name):
        print(f""Hi {name}"")

    print(""Hello World"")

So from how I understand it, if I import this file and use it as a module, ~~anything that isn't defined as a function (ie. the print Hello World) will be executed regardless if I call it or not?~~ Everything is executed, except for functions that aren't called within the module itself, of course.

&nbsp;

So to avoid that I should just put any code I do not want executed when I import this file under a 

    if __name__ == '__main__':

&nbsp;

The reason for this is if I import the file, the \_\_name\_\_ variable is the filename of the module, so it will be 

    library == '__main__':,

which is **False**, so it doesn't get executed.

&nbsp;

But if I run the file directly, the value of \_\_name\_\_ is '\_\_main\_\_', therefore it's interpreted as 

    '__main__' == '__main__'

Which is **True**, so the code is executed

Is that it? Am I correct or did I misunderstand something?

I use Visual Studio Code as editor to learn Python.

I am trying to learn building exe file and interacting with MSSQL.

1. Exe: I did a little research, it shows the first step is to Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and run **pip install pyinstaller** . Probably due to IT department setting, it blocks the code from running.

I can test building exe file in personal PC.

2. Interacting with MSSQL: I did a little research, it shows the first step is Install pyodbc ( **pip install pyodbc** ). It is also blocked from running, due to IT department setting.

That being said, I am not able to accomplish above two goals from my workplace laptop, correct?

I can use VBA (connection string) to run query and pull data from MSSQL table. But how can I do similar task(run a query and pull data from MSSQL table) with python?

I've thought of using git to somehow make it fight against an old repo of itself lol. I'm trying git worktrees so I have a folder with an old commit. Problem is I can't import the two Engine because they share the same names and everything?

Even if I rename my ""fairylion"" module name to ""fairylion\_old"", I still have lines of code in it like

    import fairylion.CONSTANT as c
    from fairylion.simple_piece import Simple_Piece
    from fairylion.move import Move, HistoryNode

which would all need to be renamed to \`fairylion\_old\` everytime i need to update the repo. (Also, if I don't change them, they would call the new fairylion module, making the old engine like the new engine lol)

Any idea?

This was recommended over creating a new connection every time I read/write to the DB.

`mydb = sql_db.connect(host=dbhost, database=dbname, user=dbuser, password=dbpass)`

Then in the various routes

`cursor = mydb.cursor()`  
`cursor.execute(test_query)`  
`result = cursor.fetchone()`  
`cursor.close()`

to run the actual queries.

Since the app is always-on (it's on a Raspberry Pi in my office) it sometimes happens that the db connection times out (remember, I've only opened it when the app started) which results in the attempt to open the cursor failing. I use `try: except:` to catch this and show an error page. But what I should really be doing is reconnecting. And there's the rub.

Using  `cursor = mydb.cursor()` succeeds inside the routes despite the mydb object having been created when the app loaded, outside them. But attempts to call `mydb.connected` fail with a UnboundLocalError which means (I think) that Python sees the mydb part of this as an uninitialized variable.

2. Formats are all over (DOI, JSON, RSS, PDFs).
3. Free automation without servers (Sheets + GitHub Actions?).

2. while it spins, the program should take screenshots of the model automatically. - the screenshots don't save permanently. - they exist temporarily to be converted into ASCII art. - the ASCII art pictures will be played in a window in a loop
3. In a terminal, the program should display the ASCII images sequentially at a chosen fps (example 30 FPS).

I tried learning numpy, tkinter, pygame but i couldnt really see how it can be used for my project.

if you have any suggestions. PLEASE reply me them. also later down the line i want to color the ascii character with what color the object's pixel originally was.",3,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n6llu6/help_spinning_ascii_obj_model_viewer_in_python/,False,True,False

I’m 30 and making a career shift from sales to something more technical but still business-related. I’m planning to enroll in an undergraduate Information Systems degree, and I keep hearing that Python and SQL are going to be essential.

I’ve been practicing Python on my own for about a week (free courses, tutorials, YouTube, and even asking ChatGPT when I get stuck). But honestly, I still struggle to build something as simple as a calculator without heavy guidance.

Even after going through multiple tutorials, I still get confused about concepts like arrays vs. objects, arrays with objects, and objects with objects. I don’t yet understand when to use one over the other, and it’s crushing my confidence.

One reason I’m motivated to learn Python is because I’ve seen how powerful automation can be in business systems like when data from a Google Form automatically transfers to HubSpot CRM, then triggers an email or even a prefilled agreement. I’d love to eventually be able to build or customize automations like that myself.

That makes me wonder: am I just not cut out for this? Or is this a normal part of the learning curve? Before I keep grinding through random tutorials, I’d love to ask the community here:

* What’s the best way for someone with zero coding background to start learning Python properly?
* Should I focus on small projects first, stick with a structured course, or follow a specific roadmap?
* How did you personally push through the “I don’t get this yet” stage?

Any advice, resources, or encouragement would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",57,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n6gno5/beginner_struggling_after_1_week_whats_the_best/,False,True,False

Hi /r/Python, I am working in digital marketing for a client which wants to extract all the email addresses (and ideally other information) out of an online database, without being in posession of the database itself. The database has a web client that offers a search function which I have screenshotted above, searching for a wildcard * allows you to access the data in the database page by page.

1. Go through each page of the database

2. Open each entry link in the database

3. Extract the email address and/or other information from each link

I was wondering what would be the best way to achieve this goal. My main confusion point would be how to get the Python program to interface with the 'next page' arrow on the website, and how to open every link displayed on each page.

While the argument is mandatory, for the options I want to set some sensible defaults that are configurable at the package level. The options could be of the mutable persuasion. 

I know about the commandment ""thou shalt not use mutables as argument's default values"" and so far my code look like this:

```python
DEFAULT_OPTION = ['banana', 'apple']

def foo(arg, option = None):

	if not option:
		option = DEFAULT_OPTION

	...

	return something_new

```

If the user doesn't provide an option value, then defaults are provided. The default could be set by the user at the start of the notebook / script. 

Does this syntax even make sense or is it just mutable arguments with extra step?

Why is it a bad idea to write something like this instead:

```python
DEFAULT_OPTION = ['banana', 'apple']

def foo(
	arg,
  option = DEFAULT_OPTION
):

	...

	return something_new

If not XML. I will parse it myself.  Basically I want to read until the first non-space character then ""unget"" it and then call the XML parse routine.

In C I would use:

    while ((c = getc(file)) >= 0 && isspace(c))
            ;
    ungetc(c,file);
    if (c == '<')
            process_xml(file);
    else
            process_text(file);

I know there is no ""ungetc"" in python. 

I can't necessarily use seek() to backup the file, it might be stdin.

An xml.etree.ElementTree object can parse a file or text, not both.

I don't want to slurp in the whole file because it could be large (probably not a big deal anymore, but...)

I see there is a way to use xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser to create a parser that I can feed the parts separately.  However, it does not just return a rooted tree like:

    import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
    tree = ET.parse('country_data.xml')
    root = tree.getroot()

It will allow me to get a list of events.  I want the tree.

Is there a way to turn the events into a tree?

first of all the reason I'm writing this post is to get some feedback about this small project (I feel proud about it)

So the story is I'm starting to learn python taking Dr. Angela Yu's Python bootcamp on udemy, it's a 100 days course and I have finished the first 10 days and also the 11's day capstone project which is creating a blackjack game

now what I did is only taking the 1st hint which is playing blackjack and understanding the game  
then I managed to create the game with all the rules and mechanics EXCEPT for the split mechanic because I just want to advance more through the course

now I know my code is probably a diabolic mess and far from clean however I feel like I've done something I wasn't sure I'm able to do

I'm gonna share the code with you and looking forward for your feedback :)

I'm making a word guess game in Python as a full-on first project (which is not part of any tutorial):

In this game you are given 7 unique letters, which the player has to make words with. As a feature, these 7 letters also make a 7-letter word as a 'word of the day' kind of thing. The words inputted by the player must follow certain conditions of course. The words have to be existing words (in my case Dutch words, because I'm Dutch). The words have to be at least 4 letters long, and may not contain certain characters.

I've found a list of words, which for all convenience contains only basic words (I hope, it says so). Luckily it contains only whole verbs and no degrees-of-comparison words. Still, it does contain words with numbers and dashes (""-""). It would also make life easier, if I could then filter words containing more than 7 unique letters and remove any word (strings of course) of less than 4 characters from the list of strings I want to use for my game.

The list of words can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenTaal/opentaal-wordlist?tab=readme-ov-file) (article in Dutch on gitHub) from which I used the ""elements/basiswoorden-gekeurd.txt"" file. Mind you of the size of this list (199403 items).

I've used [this](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/read-text-files-in-python-pulling-filtering-and-modifying-data-1101329) article (from toolify.ai) to transform the file into a list of strings (hopefully) and remove the returns (""\\n""). From this tutorial I've tried using the ""strip"" method as described.

Now **the question** is on how to continue and specifically how to correctly apply filter commands to filter the modified list to a list of my needs. So the new list: does not contain strings with numbers; does not contain strings with ""-"" in them; does not contain strings with less than 4 characters and does not contain strings with more than 7 unique letters. All strings that do not fit these criteria would have to be excluded from the list.

I couldn't find a comprehensive (enough) tutorial or other article that explains how to make a Python usable list out of a .txt file for a word game. One that might use all the words you will ever need but does meet certain custom criteria - kind of list.

All\* help will be appreciated. Please explain your code on how it works, so that I might be able to use it in other instances.

btw

200.000 sounds like a lot of words, but Dutch is one of those languages where you can combine certain words to make a new word, like wordlist and wordgame :)) So many words might be combinations. Also, I will include a function to add words to the word list (for obvious reasons).

I'm also open to improvements or totally different approaches, as long as it stays oversee-able enough for me.",0,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n5n635/making_a_list_of_words_for_a_game_in_python/,False,True,False

For that I used csv.reader to read and combine all data in both table1 & table2 file1.csv. Then I used csv.writer to combine the both csv's. But instead of keeping the original format of data, csv.writer() adds extra quotes(for instance 6 instead of 3) in the output.

Question 1:

Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a co-worker. You have access to your calendar and your co-worker's calendar (both of which contain your respective meetings for the day, in the form of startTime, and ime, as well as both of your daily working hours (ie, the earliest and latest times at which you're available for meetings every day, in the form of earliestStartline, latestEnd Time] during which you could schedule the meeting.

Write a function that takes in your calendar, your daily working hours, your co-worker's calendar, your co-worker's working hours, and the duration of the meeting that you want to schedule, and that retums a list of all the time blocks (in the form of [startTime, endTime during which you could schedule the meeting.

Note that times will be given and should be returned in 24 hour clock. For example: [1:30, 23:59] and meeting durations will always be in minutes

mention the (worst case) space and time complexity of your program with an explanation as comment

#feel free to use a data structure of your choice that best suits the problem



Sample input question 1:

YourCalendar [['9:00', '10:30'], ['12:00', '13:00'], ['16:00', '18:00']]

YourWorkingHours [9:00', '20:00'1

YourCoworkersCalendar [[10:00', '11:30'], ['12:30', '14:30'], ['14:30',

'15:00'], ['16:08', '17:00""]]

Your CoworkersworkingHours [10:00', '18:38']

meetingDuration= 30



Sample output question 1:

[['11:30', '12:00'], ['15:00', '16:00'], ['18:00', '18:30']]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2:

You're given a non-empty array of arrays where each subarray holds three integers and represents a disk. These integers denote each disk's width, depth, and height, respectively. Your goal is to stack up the disks and to maximize the total height of the stack. A disk must have a strictly smaller width, depth, and height than any other disk below it

Write a function that returns an array of the disks in the final stack, starting with the top disk and ending with the bottom disk. Note that you can't rotate disks; in other words, the integers in each subarray must represent wiath, depth, neight at all times

mention the (worst case) space and time complexity of your program with an explanation as comment

#feel free to use a data structure of your choice that best suits the problem

Sample Input:

[ [2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [2, 2, 8], [2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 1], [4, 4, 5] ]

Sample Output (Read the disks from left to right)

Data arrives as json or dataframes. I originally tried doing everything in pandas, but a lot of the transformations are conditional, based on the existing data, so I'm iterating over rows, which is not great for pandas. Also I find working with lists of dicts somehow more intuitive than working in pandas, although I do understand that a vectorized dataframe is faster when you can use it, especially for large datasets.

At the moment I'm working with lists of dicts from start to finish. ""Fields"" (key/value pairs) are sometimes modified or I'm creating new fields. The datasets are relatively small and my entire transformation process takes about 1 second from start to finish (extract and load take longer, of course, due to the connections), so making it faster isn't really a priority. The largest dataset is maybe a few thousand records.

I (mostly) understand the concept of classes and OOP, but at the same time, working with lists of dicts feels intuitive so I've just done that. But I want do things ""correctly"" in the sense that if I showed my code to someone else, their first question isn't, ""Why did you do it this way? Why didn't you use X?""

I'm currently working with financial data, so as an example, I have a person paid a yearly salary from an account from start date to end date. Using the start and end dates, I create a new list of dicts to represent each month between those dates, and then for each month, calculate the monthly salary, benefits costs, and any other surcharges that need to be included. I also use their pay increase date to figure out inflation, as well as some other details that need to be factored into the cost charged to the account. If the person has X job, I need to run these sets of calculations, and if they have Y job, it's a different set of calculations, etc. I need it by month because I need to eventually display cost over time, and it will eventually be combined with all the other salary costs over time.

Should the person be a class and then the months are created as a method? Or a subclass? And then monthly salary, surcharges, etc, are methods? Is this a good use case for data classes? Or the attrs package? I do realize it might be hard to answer this question without seeing my code. I don't really have anyone at the moment to review what I'm doing or provide feedback. What I'm doing works but I can't help but feel like I'm missing something. I guess I'm looking for someone for whom this scenario sounds familiar so I can get advice on how to approach it. I'm hesitant to refactor everything using classes when data classes or attrs might be a better approach.",11,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n5baii/lists_of_dicts_vs_classes_vs_data_classes_vs_attrs/,False,True,False

The app shows the prices of CS2 sticker capsules I invested in (only \~$30 lol).

The problem: I tried to make an overlay that shows the price of a capsule when you hover over its image, and disappears when you move the mouse away. But the overlay keeps flickering and I can’t get it to stop.

What I tried:

* Used the frame of the image as the event detector -> still flickers.
* Tried using the image itself -> horrendous, caused even more issues. So I went back to using frames, but the flickering remains.

Has anyone dealt with this kind of overlay flickering before? I can't figure out a solution.

After that I worked a bunch of random jobs, but now I’ve finally decided what I want to do: programming.

The thing is, programming is a huge field. There are so many directions and right now I have no clue which part I want to focus on. 

I just know I’d like something with decent pay, not insanely competitive, and hopefully a good work life balance (most preferred from home).

A friend of mine started this programming school. It’s all online, they give you video courses to watch and then you get a certificate at the end. He also says they offer you a job afterwards, but honestly that sounds kind of unrealistic. He also told me programmers only work 4 hours a day because otherwise you’ll lose your mind, which sounds very unrealistic.


Personally I’d rather learn from YouTube or cheaper online courses because it seems way more flexible and affordable. The problem is I think I need a certificate if I ever want to land a job.

So my questions are:
What area of programming should I even focus on as a beginner?
Is self learning with cheap courses enough or do companies really care about certificates?
Should I just spend a lot on a certificate program and hope it helps me get hired?

I’m currently learning **control structures** and the **input() function** in Python.  
Here are some beginner-friendly exercises I tried:

1. Ask the user to enter a number and print whether it’s even or odd.
2. Take the user’s age and decide if they are eligible to vote.
3. Write a small program that asks for a password and checks if it matches the correct one.

These helped me understand how `if/else` and `input()` work together.  
Do you have any other cool practice ideas for beginners?

that creates a bunch of records files from input files in raw formats.
Also the application integrates an API to make metadata and operations
available to the frontend. I'm a solo self-taught developer working at a
company that produces small software products.

Also; I'm working on getting my computer science degree, I'm in my second
year. There are more people at the company but rarely two people
work on the same codebase. The application that I mentioned I worked all
alone and it is still not finished.

The problem: I'm facing a really belly ache hard time with the
overwhelming amount of decisions to make. I have to deliver a
development version in 15 days, and currently my application works and
implements 90% of committed functionality, but is my creation of
quality? well, that is a completely different story. Automated tests?
somehow, a few .sh scripts that perform the operations and check the results
and outputs and carry out the set up and clean up operations.
Is my code orthogonal? well, pretty much, each functional block tears down
into a command line interface that outputs a JSON-formatted outputs and
receives a JSON-formatted input. What makes the development cycle less
painful.
But at this point, if I look at my repo is a mess, just a long line of
commits on main. I have refactored into a more clean-up repository
with a 'dev' branch, another 'main' branch that hold only working and tested code
(as learned recently in college) and performing merges and PR (even if
I'm the only one working on the project and anybody is reviewing
how I'm doing my craft, all that is required of me is ""to deliver to the
client the instructions for your application to work, if it does not work
you are responsible for troubleshooting"").

But the problem araise when I start making the following questions,
should I improve the error handling policies? or should I wait until a
problem reported by the user appear? how should I structure my code so
is not a mess solve a problem when araise? Should I use a database for
state of batches handling or my only persistence system should serve the
needs of the bussiness logic? should I implement a logic for database
handling like backup and provide resilience? should I need a queue of
batch processing jobs? Should I use a database for holding this batch
queue? is actually a use case the accumulation of files to process?

Until now I've done the happy path — minimal working code — but my
code feels sloppy, unprofessional. I know my job is to deliver
something that works; nobody cares about nested ifs or print
debugging. But I don’t want future me saying, “This is a mess,
start over.” Honestly, I’m already there — so I want to level up.
Pairing with a pro would help, but that’s not an option now.

For now, I'm reading \*The Pragmatic Programmer\*, \*Código Sostenible\*,
and \*Fluent Python\* to go deeper.
Doing nothing just delays the pain. So while stumbling in the dark,
I keep coding and cleaning.
Anyone been here? What helped you improve? What made you think,
“Okay, now I’m doing this right”?
Is there an IRC/Discord for open questions like:
“Is using a DB for a job batch queue a good idea?”
Also, are there courses focused on real projects or software
engineering — not just syntax? Like: start with minimal code,
then refactor, structure repos, etc.? I can’t find any.
I know my situation’s a bit rare — most people have teams: DevOps,
backend, DB, etc. But resources like \*The Pragmatic Programmer\* 
does not speaks to solo devs.

(1) The user enters the name in one entry - we should check if the entry is valid (at least one blank space)  
(2) We split the entry into two variables (first is name, the second is everything else - other names, middle names, surnames) to use them later in various messages and expressions  
(3) The user enters a number (integer) of purchases in the previous period  
(4) We check if the entry is valid (integer) and if the number of purchases is above zero (while/try/break/continue/except loop)  
(5) If the number of purchases is 0, we ask the user if they maybe made a mistake by asking ""Is your number of purchases really 0""? If Yes, the program ends. If No, the program continues. If anything else is entered, the program goes back to the question ""Is your number of purchases really 0""?  
(6) Based on the number of purchases entered in step (3), we ask the user to enter the amount of each purchase (for loop)  
(7) We check if the entry of amounts is valid (if it's float or string - while/try/break/continue/except loop) and if the amount of each purchase is greater than zero

(8) Now, based on the number of purchases entered in step (3), we create a counter that counts the purchases the value of which is above USD 100. - using for loop, but def is also allowed  
(9) Also, we must calculate the total value of all purchases.

(10) If the user has more than 10 purchases (step 8) and the total value of all purchases (step 9) is greater than USD 1000, the user gets the PREMIUM status and a discount of 10%. Otherwise, the user gets the STANDARD status and a discount of 5%.

Now, I know how to create all steps except step (6) and (7). **I tried to define a function that counts the purchases above USD 100, but I always get an incorrect result**. Also, **I tried to define a function that sums the amounts of all purchases, but I always get an incorrect result.** I tried to do both these loops **without defining new functions**, as well, just by using ""for"". I also used ""range"" because integers and floats cannot be used in ""for"" without ""range"". I also tried to use range(1, number\_of\_purchases) and (1, number\_of\_purchases+1), but I always get an incorrect result.

So, please help me solve this. I'm so frustrated, and I simply LOVE Python and coding. But I've been hitting a wall for days now and I believe I tried everything.

This is how the basic skeleton of the code looks like in steps (3) and (6), where I removed the loops for checking if the entries are valid, for clarity:  
  
number\_of\_purchases = int(input(""Enter the number of purchases: "")  
for entered\_number in range(number\_of\_purchases)  
entered\_number +=1  
while True:  
try:  
amount = float(input(f""Enter the amount of purchase {entered\_number}: ""))  
if amount <= 0:  
print(""Error, the amount must be greater than zero."")  
else:  
break  
except ValueError:  
print(""Error, you've entered a text. Please enter a whole or decimal number."")

This works like a charm, also within the while/try/break/continue/except loops that check the validity of the entries and various conditions.

But I'm hopelessly stuck at steps (8) and (9). Any help will be much appreciated. Even hints!

Since I specified the `build-system` in project.toml (uv_build), my package is installed in editable mode. 

This works well for a time. I can test my package and even modify it, and it will work on my notebook testing file. But seemingly randomly, after a while, the venv breaks and cannot find the module anymore. 

Today for example I left the computer with the module working fine. I got back after a few ours, restarted vscode and the `ModuleNotFoundError` has greeted me. Both trying to run the notebook with venv or `uv run python -c ""import keecas""`.

The only reliable fix is to delete the .venv folder and recreate with `uv sync`. Sometime `uv pip installs -e .` would fix the error, but not always. 

I'm quite baffled. 

Doesn't help that it's my first time using macos, so a not familiar with it, but vscode and terminal should be quite the same as on windows or Linux. ",1,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n479ej/modulenotfounderror_after_a_while/,False,True,False

I am not proficient in MATLAB and I am still very much in the beginning phases of building this program. There's so much that I don't know and it's scary sometimes. Considering that I haven't worked with python before, I don't really know where to begin. I don't want to be stuck in the phase of watching courses/tutorials and then find myself not learning a single thing. What I coded in MATLAB so far is functions that take in data from excel files and give me results along with visuals. I want my program to take in input from the user, and then allow them to select a method for calculation, and get the output. That's the simplest I can describe it. It's almost like an engineering calculator/toolkit. Whenever I think about this I get overwhelmed with stuff like IDEs, GUI, different websites, different videos and the cycle continues. Unfortunately, I don't have a mentor and lacking direction. How can I pinpoints the parts of python I need and then learn them to make for a smooth transition?

* functions

* data types

* loops and conditionals

* classes

* lists/tuples

* dictionaries

* libraries

* exceptions

* file input/output

I think that covers the Python basics?

**However**, my knowledge of those topics are very surface level. Like, I understand what they do. And I can write very simple code that requires them. If I read other basic code by other newbies, I can at least understand what's going on. 

But often times I have to google some details (""oh, right, the break should go here and not there""). 

And when I have to chain multiple of them together (ex: make a function that takes user input for a list of items, and make it a loop until the word ""elephant"" is entered, and then ask them again for a second list and make a dictionary out of the first and second list values), I'm completely lost.

&nbsp;

So my question is, do I keep practicing the basics? Keep learning them over and over until I can do what I want with them without looking anything up, or is it ok to move now to more advanced topics like frameworks, etc...

I recently started playing with VBA and Python at work to automate a lot my tasks. My scripts can parse and structure data, pull data from Excel and output it onto a legacy app we use to process cases, and utilizes win32com, pyperclip, and pyautogui, locateOnScreen, pixel detection to dynamically click buttons for me, and many other modules.

I’ve been making a lot of progress and have been able to process cases in 30-45 seconds, so I pinged the VP of our Insights and Reporting team asking him if he can take a look at my scripts. My expectations were pretty low. I just wanted to get his thoughts and ask him what certifications I should aim for to move up in my career.

During the meeting I quickly demo’d one of my VBA macros that when I highlight multiple rows, it run each record through our terminal system and pull all these codes and ID’s and structure them onto this one column in this format “Consumer (4S) - ST 13 - 9999”

Once he saw that he immediately commented “woah that was slick”, which took me by surprise as I thought this guy had seen it all. I then start showing him more macros that parse and structure data, then I moved onto my Python scripts that combines Excel and another software we use to process our work, and he was still dumbfounded how I was able to use Python and VBA to combine 2 legacy apps with Excel.

After the meeting ended he quickly pings his boss, the director of strategy and insights, and asks if I could hop back on the meeting to show him.

Once again, I demo a few macros/scripts to the Senior VP and he recognized my userid being the top performer last week. Towards the end of the meeting they’re asking me if I know SQL, telling me to request access to our database so I can learn, tell anyone to ask them if they have any questions why I’m requesting access, wanting to schedule a meeting with me and their automation team, and mentioning RPA costs.

After THAT meeting ends, the VP pings his boss “I shared the basics of Power Query to him a year ago. He learned everything else on his own” and the SVP responds “crazy” followed with “he’s about to make a lot more than he does now”

Right now I’m shaken up. They’re basically handing me the keys to the vault, asking me to demo my tools with their automation team, and looking into moving me to a different department asap with a huge pay increase. They asked me if I had a resume that reflects my new skills and there aren’t any openings right now, but have it ready just in case.

I never thought Python would take me this far and I’ve only been using it for less than a month, VBA 4 months, and Excel 4+ years.

Wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or created any advanced analytics tools with Python.

Edit: I wanted to add that this is a large national bank I work for. I’m currently making $67k/year, so now I’m wondering where I go from here.

The title is a bit vague so I will try to elaborate briefly here, I have seen only one other post such as this in this sub ( new to reddit I could've queried wrong) and it is primarily about me being fascinated with Cyber security & programming. Specifically with machine learning as well. I love building powerful things and using data to do so, like the idea of an IDS system hand built by me is very exciting. Not in a lucrative sense but from a fun standpoint. Going off track, my original question is essentially that do you believe it to be wise to study Cybersecurity as my primary topic of study ( I am attending WGU for BCSIA, tryhackme , etc.) while also delving into topics of machine learning. Such as the mathematics behind it, building programs with scikit learn and python, etc. I do think that python should be learned regardless Whether I did only cyber sec or both but still I will add it into the ML path for comparison sake. Most of this learning would be reading book such as intro to ML with scikit learn, or the how machines learn, and others, then just building things with the knowledge I obtain from said books. Cyber sec I love as well, hence the other things like tryhackme, & ctfs that I am starting to get into. I understand that ML skill is not looked at upon entry level employers and that it's useless to learn in that sense, but I wanted to get your input on if you believe it will be useful possibly in the future of my profession or maybe just good knowledge to have. I currently work an InfoSec tech role and the most programming I do is when i leave the office lol. I also have disgusting OCD, this idea of picking the most optimal path of learning something is a massive crux of mine. Hence this post. But yea that is pretty much it. Thank you for time in reading this slop and hopefully taking the time to give input. Thank you!!

I’m building a chatbot for grocery stores and restaurants where customers can ask about prices or place orders in **natural language**. For example, they might type:

""i want some dossa and vada"",

""get me bryani and fish cury"",

""order hopers and putu"",

""i need some சமசா papadam"",

""get me කොත්තු and වඩේ""

I already have a big **food entity list** (thousands of items in English, Tamil, Sinhala, etc.). The challenge is:

* Users spell things wrong (e.g. *bryani* → *biryani*, *dossa* → *dosa*)
* They mix scripts/languages in one query (Tamil + English + Sinhala)
* Some are transliterated words (*hopers* → *hoppers*, *pol roty* → *pol roti*)

So before sending anything to an LLM, I need to **extract the correct food entities efficiently and accurately**.

* **TF-IDF similarity**
* **FuzzyWuzzy / RapidFuzz**
* **difflib.SequenceMatcher**

* Handles **thousands of entities efficiently**
* Is **fast** enough for real-time chat
* Doesn’t compromise on **accuracy**

I'm sure I'm being obtuse here, apologies ahead of time.

currently, I'm trying to extract the background landscapes of [microsoft bob](https://archive.org/details/microsoft-home-collection-1993-1995-) (it's on the compilation.iso I believe; and you'll probably need a VM to run it as well). someone made an [extractor tool](https://archive.org/details/msbob_actors) for the actor assets, but I'm not quite sure how to use it - or if it'd help me with what I'm looking for either..

I downloaded the most recent Python from the official website, but microsoft store popped up when I tried ""python"" in cmd. I'm assuming I missed a PATH option? Someone was saying there'd be a win\_add2path.py file in a tools folder, but I couldn't find a tools folder. I manually added the scripts folder to PATH, but that didn't seem to fix anything. I installed the microsoft store version of Python. after lots of gripe, I deleted the first copy of Python, but realized there's no scripts folder in the other version. I was also assuming this project could be exported as an exe file, but after skimming the [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724061432/http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5167) the creator used, I'm not actually sure if that's the case. And now it's been a collective several hours - I'm tired, and have had no genuine interest in this program to begin with. 

I just want to see/download some delicious pixel art without a dog/rat/etc on top of it telling me to start a program. is it truly this hard? surely I'm missing something.. if someone either gives me a mega eli5-esque tutorial or just the bg files (like the woods, space battle, city etc - and they'll probably be .wmf which is fine), I'd greatly appreciate it!!

While doing some research, I came across people recommending using a virtual environment to install/manage dependencies to avoid issues. I went down the rabbit hole of venv and started to think that yes, it will 100% help with system dependencies, but it also makes it more complicated for a project that multiple people could potentially work on later on. Meaning, every time someone clones the repo, they will have to create their local venv. If we add more Python projects later on, the developer will have to create the venv on their machine and also assign it in their VS Code. I felt like it would be too much setup and add overhead.

So I then thought about using Docker. I thought it would be preferable and would make it easier. It would avoid adding any difficulties when installing/cloning the project locally. It also makes it easy to use on any machine/server.

Before I make my decision, I just wanted to get the community's opinion/feedback on that approach. Is it better to use venv or Docker?",23,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1n2o4o7/python_venv_vs_docker/,False,True,False

1. On the create functionality, when I create my DB, I give it a name. I want to test if the named object (the db list) exists but I don't know how to do that without checking if the name exists in the globals() namespace.

   a. I can check that a name exists in locals() but is that really reflective of what would happen in production?

   b. how do you create test cases that would mimic the functionality in production?

   c. the only way I think I could even create a named db is to assign a name from within the test case against the fixture, is there another way to access the name?



2. On the delete functionality:

More precisely: I would like all figures to have the same height, while the width can differ according to how much data I have. E.g. if I want two bar plots with the same height, but the first plot has 3 bars while the second one has 6 bars, I want the second one to be roughly double as wide so that nothing is distorted.

The next problem is that all tick labels count to the figure size. Defining the figure size is therefore not feasible, since a longer text on the label will mean that there is less size for the canvas, creating a mismatch between both figures.

Is there a way to fix the canvas size in place (even if I have to fix the width as well) and force matplotlib to add to the figure size according to other factors like tick label sizes etc? If so, what is a feasible way to ""ask"" matplotlib what the actual size of the canvas or the actual size of any other object in the figure is?

When converting to png the centering works with no problems.

Short example using the whole display as a rect:

    import pygame

    while True:

I am writing some code that reads an incoming serial prompt and translates the received data into a GUI. I've got some buttons on the 'master' device which sends button press states over the COM Port. To save some time I've created some for loops and functions which create the grid array and assign variables to them, but am struggling to update specific label text attribute when referring to it via another routine. I've got a variable which matches against what the label is called, however as Python/Tkinter is looking at it as a string rather than an assigned Tkinter label it is erroring out. What's the best way I can resolve this?

        def buttonSetupArray(self):
            self.buttonListStates = [""SINGLE_PRESS"", ""DOUBLE_PRESS"", ""LONG_PRESS""]
            self.buttonStrings = []
            buttonList = [""Enter"", ""Up"", ""Down""]
            buttonRemMax = 8
            for i in range(1,(buttonRemMax+1)):
                buttonList.append(""Button"" + str(i))
            for i in range(0, len(buttonList)):
                for x in range(0, len(self.buttonListStates)):
                    concatButtonStrings = buttonList[i] + "" "" + self.buttonListStates[x]
                    self.buttonStrings.append(concatButtonStrings)
            # print(""Button string checks set up!"")
    
        def buttonCheckPoll(self):
            self.buttonDictStates = {}
            for i in range(0, len(self.buttonStrings)):
                buttonStringCheck = self.stringCheck(self.buttonStrings[i])
                if buttonStringCheck == True: 
                    self.buttonDictStates.update({self.buttonStrings[i] : buttonStringCheck})
                    # print(self.buttonStrings[i] + "" Returned true"")
                    self.varChanger = self.buttonStrings[i].replace("" "", ""_"")
                    print(self.varChanger)
                    self.varChanger['text'] = (""First click"")
                    self.varChanger.configure(text=""red"")

This is the function that creates the labels:

    def buttonFrameSetup(self, tkElement, statusText, gridrow, gridcol, statusTextVar):
            tk.Label(tkElement, text=statusText).grid(row=gridrow, column=gridcol)
            self.buttonFrameState1 = statusTextVar + ""_"" + self.buttonListStates[0]
            self.buttonFrameState2 = statusTextVar + ""_"" + self.buttonListStates[1]
            self.buttonFrameState3 = statusTextVar + ""_"" + self.buttonListStates[2]
            self.buttonFrameState1 = tk.Label(tkElement, text=""None"")
            self.buttonFrameState1.grid(row=gridrow, column=gridcol+1)
            self.buttonFrameState2 = tk.Label(tkElement, text=""None"")
            self.buttonFrameState2.grid(row=gridrow, column=gridcol+2)
            self.buttonFrameState3 = tk.Label(tkElement, text=""None"")
            self.buttonFrameState3.grid(row=gridrow, column=gridcol+3)

If I specifically point the output of buttonCheckPoll to a label not created using buttonFrameSetup, on the main Tk() thread it works fine, so I'm a little confused here.

    tk.Label(tab2, text=""Button Status: "").grid(row=2, column=0)
                    
                    self.buttonFrameSetup(tab2, ""Button1 Button State"", 6, 0, ""Button1"")
                    self.root.after(250, self.buttonCheckPoll)

    self.varChanger['text'] = (""First click"")

Putting this in my own words:

1. Create a list ""WIDTH"" with 70 columns, all set to 0
2. Use random.random() to generate a random number between 0 an 1 for all 70 entries in WIDTH
3. If the random number is less than .02, assign a ""stream counter"" between 4 and 14 to that column
4. If the random number is not less than .02, print ' ' (empty space)
5. For all columns with a number (between 4 and 14 from step 3 above) print either 0 or 1
6. Decrease the ""stream counter"" by 1 in that column
7. Return to step 2

The part where I get stuck is - doesn't the program start over again from ""for i in range (WIDTH)"" and therefore what is the point of step 6? Once the loop restarts, won't every column be assigned a random number again between 0 and 1 to determine if it will have anything printed in that column?

    import random, sys, time
    
    WIDTH = 70  # The number of columns
    
    try:
        # For each column, when the counter is 0, no stream is shown
        # Otherwise, it acts as a counter for how many times a 1 or 0
        # should be displayed in that columm.
        columns = [0] * WIDTH
        while True:
            # Loop over each column
            for i in range(WIDTH):
                if random.random() < 0.02:
                    # Restart a stream counter on this column,
                    # The stream length is between 4 and 14 charcaters long.
                    columns[i] = random.randint(4, 14)
    
                # Print a character in this columns:
                if columns[i] == 0:
                    # Change this ' '' to '.' to see the empty spaces:
                    print(' ', end='')
                else:
                    # Print a 0 or 1:
                    print(random.choice([0, 1]), end='')
                    columns[i] -= 1  # Decrement the counter for this column.

Otherwise, I was a humanities major who stayed away from STEM as much as possible. A few years out of college, and I haven't needed coding for my career thus far.

My boyfriend is currently finishing a master's in finance that has a special focus on programming and data science. He encouraged me to try Kaggle to learn some new skills and see if I like coding. In the introduction to coding/Python course, I enjoyed figuring out the commands and solving the logic puzzles of the exercises. Once I moved on to the real Python course, I became totally lost. New commands started coming without any explanation, and with some of the exercise solutions, there is not enough of an explanation to understand why it's correct. 

Are there other sites or resources similar to Kaggle but that are genuinely tailored to beginners or learners who want to go at a slower pace? Maybe my brain just isn't cut out for it, but I feel like Python could be really fun if I could have more exercises with more ample explanations.

I am quiet new to the virtual environments in python. I like the concept so I try to dig in now.

But there is a question raised in my head a few times now. Some linux packages, for example, waydroid request python packages to work properly. These packages using the global python environment I guess.

Some python packages are requested to install in a virtual environment only to avoid problems.

So if now such a linux package requires such a python package what is the idea to deal with? Of course I could install the python pkg in global env but this does totally not align with the intentions behind this feature.

These are being loaded from a flat file, so assume I can't deal with the data upstream.

Sample list: `sample = [['a111', 2],['b222', 0],['this looks fine', 'but is not fine'],['this also looks fine', None],['c333', 5],['d444', 0],[None,None]]`

Of those elements, I would want just `[['a111', 2],['c333', 5]]`

Examples of possible values for `name` include `None`, `'valid_name'` and `'non_valid_string'`. I want to filter out the `None` values, and the `non_valid_string` values can be actually filtered out with the quantity. So filtering on `name` is pretty straightforward

Examples of possible values for `quantity` include `None`, `0`, `18` and `'non_valid_string'`. I want to filter out the `None` values as well but also the `non_valid_string` and where value is `0`. Basically, I just want quantities where `quantity>0`

So I initially had:
    if name and quantity:
	    if quantity > 0:
	
but that doesn't work where `quantity='non_valid_string'`

The only way I've gotten this to work is:
if name and quantity:
    if quantity.isdigit() and quantity > 0:
	
but I just feel like I could be doing this cleaner. I was thinking about a try/except block but just have too much data manipulation relying on this logic.

When creating a mesh from scratch, you have to tell it EXACTLY what's going on. What I messed up was almost all of it. The vertices were made with the shape in mind originally. Now, they are made with the triangles in mind. Each set of 3 vertices are a triangle within the shape. This made putting in the triangles easier and allowed me to have specified uvs so the texture stopped stretching in that weird way.

Now I am working on some project, where I must use socket plugin but one big mistake appers. I code this program to transfer numeral data from one computer to another. When I take both codes ( server and client ) and run it on one coputer the data transfer works perfectly well. Sunddenly I want to transfer data from to another soo I take the cleint code and paste it on raspberry pi. When the client code is on raspberry the data doesn\`t transfer.

I'm an experienced python dev so this isn't really ""help"", but apologies to the mods if it's nonetheless not allowed :)

## Background

First, my understanding of the situation so that we're all on the same page(/so someone can correct me if I'm wrong!):

### Assumption #1

According to [`packaging.python.org`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/), there's a pretty simple ontology for this subject:

1. **Projects** are source file directories, which are ""packaged"" into [**""distribution packages""**](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package), aka just ""distributions"". This is the ""P"" in in PyPI.

2. Distributions in turn contain (nested) [**""import packages""**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages), which is what 99% of developers use the term ""package"" to mean 99% of the time.

3. Less important, but just for completion: import packages contain [**modules**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#), which in turn contain **classes**, **functions**, and **variables**.

### Assumption #2

You're basically forced to structure your source code directory (your ""Project"") as if it contained multiple packages. Namely, to publish a tool that users would install w/ `pip install mypackage` and import a module w/ `from mypackage import mymodule`, your project must be setup so that there's a `mypackage/src/mypackage/mymodule.py` file.

You can drop the `/src/` with some build systems, but the second `mypackage` is pretty much mandatory; some backends allow you to avoid it with tomfoolery that they explicitly warn against (e.g. [`setuptools`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html)), and others forbid it entirely (e.g. [`uv-build`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/build-backend)).

### Assumption #3

I've literally never installed a dependency that exposes multiple packages, at least knowingly. The closest I've seen is something like [PyJWT](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt), which is listed under that name but imported with `import jwt`. Still, obviously, this is just a change in package names, not a new package altogether.

Again, something like `datetime` isn't exposing multiple top-level packages, it's just exposing `datetime` which in turn contains the *sub-*packages `date`, `time`, `datetime`, etc.

## Discussions

Assuming all/most of that is correct, I'd love if anyone here could answer/point me to the answer on any of these questions:

1. Is there a political history behind this setup? Did multi-package projects used to be common perhaps, or is this mirroring some older language's build system?

2. Has this been challenged since [PIP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) (?) setup this system in 2015? Are there any proposals or projects centered around removing the extraneous dir?

3. Does this bother anyone else, or am I insane??

Thanks for taking the time to read :) Yes, this whole post is because it bothers me to see `mypackage/mypackage/` in my CLI prompt. Yes, I'm procrastinating. Don't judge please!

I’ve been working with Azure Integration Services (Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Event Hub, etc.) for a while — but always with C# / .NET.

Now I want to get into Python for Azure — mainly for:
	•	Writing Azure Functions in Python
	•	Building automation scripts for cloud workflows
	•	General integration use cases where Python is preferred over C#

I’m already familiar with programming concepts (OOP, async, APIs, deployment), so I don’t need a beginner’s “what is a variable” type of course. I just want the fastest practical route to being productive in Python specifically for Azure.

My questions:
	1.	What’s the best course/tutorial to quickly get up to speed with Python (given my C# background)?
	2.	Should I start with a general crash course (Mosh, BroCode, etc.) or jump directly into Azure Python projects?

I’ve got a Python app running as a **Windows service**. It connects to an **MQTT broker**, listens on a few topics, and writes data into a **database**.

I want to make sure it’s **rock solid** ... always running, recovering from crashes, and handling errors properly. To do that, I’m trying to build a test setup where I can break stuff on purpose and see how the service reacts.

Stuff I’d like to simulate:

* **MQTT issues**: broker offline, network drop, bad credentials, broker freezing up.
* **Database issues**: DB offline, network cut, bad schema/credentials, hitting connection limits.
* **App errors**: malformed JSON, random exceptions, memory/resource exhaustion.
* **Service behavior**: making sure it auto-restarts on crash and logging works.

Looking for tips on:

* How to actually simulate these failures (MQTT/DB/network).
* Best tools/libraries to automate testing (pytest? docker? something else?).
* Patterns in code to make it more resilient (retries, backoff, try/except).

The production environment is Windows Server 2019. Unfortunately I cannot deploy a docker on that machine.

Apart from unit testing that I have done to test message parsers what else can I test?  
I am using win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework to create my service.  
I deploy it like so: [`myservice.py`](http://myservice.py) `install` and [`myservice.py`](http://myservice.py) `start`

How can I make sure all exceptions will be handled properly? How can I intentionally cause errors and check if the service will recover?  
How can I simulate database errors without having to unplug the cable from the database server?

I want to create a full regression test that I can repeat it.

Basically: how do you folks test and harden services like this before shipping them?

In this program `r1`, `r2` and so on are the required resources and `n1`, `n2` and so on are the number required to make 1 batch of potions. Each batch has 5 potions. `sets` is the number of batches you want to make. `fee` is the usage fee for each batch of potions. `rr` is the return rate. So if for example I have enough materials for 100 batch of potions, and your return rate is 15% then yoou get 15% of the materials back which can again be used to make more potions but you can't make any more if there isn't enough for 1 batch. This is why I wrote

    m = min(x for x in [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6] if x != 0)
    
    b = 0
    while m > 1:
        m = round( m * rr )
        b = b + m
        continue

Here `b` gives the total extra potions that I made.

I used the program to calculate the costs and then did the math myself and the differnce is just too big. Can someone tell me where I am going wrong?

I'm designing a test suite and in my case is convenient to have ab abstract class of a generic test, with some methods that are shared among all the  subclasses.

Then, I create the subclasses from the abstract class, that contain specific methods and specific parameters for a given test.

When I run the test, I only instantiate one at the time the subclasses; so there is really no difference between instantiate the subclass or make all the methods as class methods and call directly the class.

Is this a common/accepted scenario?

I'm working on transferring the value of the database sheet to ws2. Among them, all the data is imported, but it can't be merged.

The information of the testitem is written on one line in the database, but when it comes to ws2, it is written in more than one line. At this time, if it is the same testitem, it would be good to merge all the A column of rows of ws2, and some cases, the testitem is divided into two rows in db, and even at this time, if the name of the Testitem is the same, I would like to merge them all. Also, if column B is empty, I would like to merge it with column A and organize the report neatly.

Below is the code that is currently in use. I'm guessing that about two of the testitems are not merged with column A after the B column is merged first, so an error occurs.

The library calls these functions with an instance of a particular class containing various call details and data - I think this is a pretty standard architecture.

Now, it turns out I sometimes want to invoke one of these callbacks 'manually'. In this case, I don't have an actual MessageClass object to work with, so instead, I fake it out by using a named tuple. See code below:

```

	import library, MessageClass
	from collections import namedtuple

	# the library module requires specifying various callback functions, into which
	# is passed an instance of a MessageClass object:
		
	@library.event
	def callback(message: MessageClass):
		'''
		message is a class instance that contains various attributes such as:
		
		message.user
		message.event_type
		message.data
		etc.

		callback uses these to carry out some action
		'''
		...
		
		
	def user_call():
		Message = namedtuple('Message', ['user', 'event_type', 'data'])    
		fake_message = Message('Joe','click',(100,100))
		callback(fake_message)

Anyways, I made small game of PIG for practicing the basics. It works fine, but I ran into a problem when adding in a feature to replay the game that involves the input() method. 

The intended purpose is to prompt the user to say ""yes"" if they want to replay the game or ""no"" if they don't(but if whatever is inputted isn't yes it'll just default to ending. Just keeping it simple). The actual result is that input() returns an empty string without actually waiting for the user to input anything.

I’m trying to recreate the way TBS time-compresses their shows and movies. Their audio has this jumpy/skippy effect, but the video still looks smooth because they blend or drop frames.

I’ve got the **audio part down perfectly**, but the **video is the problem**.

Here’s what my workflow looks like right now:

1. Take the original video and audio.
2. Compare it to the time-compressed version (“skippy” audio).
3. Align the video frames with the time-compressed/skippy audio using Python (MoviePy + FFmpeg + librosa for DTW).

It’s syncing correctly, so the video matches the audio, but **the video jumps awkwardly** — like frames are skipped for a few milliseconds. I tried cross-dissolving frames for smoother jumps, but it still looks jumpy, especially during larger time warps.

I’m basically trying to do what TBS does: keep the audio jumpy, but have the **video playback look smooth**.

I know this might require **motion-compensated frame interpolation**, but I’m not sure if there’s a good Python-native approach, or if I should use AI-based tools like **RIFE** or **DAIN**. I have a feeling though that itll crash my computer because it did like 5 times.

I am cross posting to a few subs looking for advice. A friend is starting a full stack development course and needs help choosing a laptop. He needs Windows, 8 GB RAM minimum, 4 cores, ideally 8 threads. Target budget is 500 to 600 euros, if possible or doable

I am no expert for programming so I am not sure exactly what could be enough for him. Workload will include HTML5, CSS3, Java, DOM, JSON, Python and MySQL

What would you recommend in this price range that is reliable for a beginner?

If possible, 16 GB RAM but we are not too picky as he knows this laptop might be only temporary. (He is working abroad)

Acceptable CPUs (I am assuming the course was indicated for a desktop setup)

* Intel Core i3 8xxx, i5 10xxx, i7 3xxx or newer
* AMD Ryzen 5 2600 or newer

I had considered an MSI but he would really like to stick to a 600 euro budget tops.

He sent me this: [https://amzn.eu/d/5d3MJwt](https://amzn.eu/d/5d3MJwt) Might be enough for this course and workloads? Any other advice or recomendations?

Thanks in advance!

I’m a PhD student (basic medical science) who wants to get into **HD spatial transcriptomics (10x Visium HD)** analysis. My ultimate goal is to be able to do a full workflow independently:

* Import HD spatial data (images + expression matrices + metadata)
* Perform QC and filtering
* Run clustering/annotation
* Visualize spatial maps (whole tissue, specific ROIs, condition-specific plots)
* Apply conditional filtering and highlight subsets
* Calculate areas under certain rules (e.g., fibrosis vs inflammation regions)
* Compare these regions between conditions for differential analysis

**My background:**

* I know Python basics and have some experience with **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
* I’m comfortable handling expression matrices in tables.
* But I’m new to image handling, spatial data structures, and bioinformatics pipelines.

**My questions:**

1. What’s a reasonable **learning path** to get from where I am now to being able to do HD spatial transcriptomics analysis?
2. Should I start by learning **Pillow** (for image handling), or go straight to spatial transcriptomics frameworks (like `scanpy`, `spatialdata`, `squidpy`)?
3. Which **prerequisite skills** are really necessary before I can meaningfully work with HD data (e.g., image basics, clustering, plotting)?
4. Are there any **recommended tutorials, courses, or example projects** that cover both the image side and the transcriptomic side together?
5. For someone aiming to not just follow tutorials but **design my own analyses**, what concepts/tools should I prioritize?

**TL;DR:**  
I have NumPy/Pandas basics. I want to reach the point where I can independently run **HD spatial transcriptomics analysis** (QC → clustering → visualization → ROI/area stats → differential analysis). What’s the best step-by-step learning path to get there?

2 ( counts as 1 and 2) then repeats

3 ( counts 1 till 3 ) then repeats

4 ( counts 1 till 4 ) then repeats

until the number 10 is done.

so for example the number 2 has been repeated 5 times

3 has been repeated 3 times

4 has been repeated 2 times

5 has been repeated 2 times.

and in the end 10 has of course been repeated only 1 time. since 10 is the end point in counting.

however this counting for the numbers 2 till 10 needs to be done in parallel and as fast as possible and show me the result of cycles of the other numbers and be accurate.

I previously shared this but accidentally deleted it — reposting here for those who might still be interested.

I’ve been experimenting with a small prototype to explore **AI accountability**.  
The idea is simple but fun:

* Evaluate AI actions against configurable policies
* Trace **who is responsible** when a rule is violated
* Generate JSON audit trails
* Integrate with CLI / notebooks / FastAPI

I’m **not a professional programmer**, so I relied heavily on AI coding assistants to help me put this together.  
The prototype is definitely **not production-ready** — it’s just a learning experiment to see how Python can express these ideas.

Would love to hear feedback, especially on whether the **Python structure** (functions, style, organization) could be improved.

Do atexit functions always run before daemonic threads are killed?

I thought functions registered with atexit were not supposed to wait for daemonic threads to finish, and they only wait for nondaemonic threads. Daemonic threads are supposed to be killed at soon as the main process is shut down, so I thought any atexit registered function would see any daemonic thread as dead. But with this toy script:

        import atexit, threading, time

        def test_loop():
            while True:
                time.sleep(5)

        def run_on_exit():
            with open(""debug.log"",'a') as f:
                f.write(f""\nIs t alive?: {str(t.is_alive())}\n"")
                f.write('\n'.join([str(i) for i in threading.enumerate()]))

            time.sleep(10) #wait to see if daemon thread stops while the atexit function is still running...

            with open(""debug.log"",'a') as f:
                f.write(f""\nIs t still alive?: {str(t.is_alive())}\n"")
                f.write('\n'.join([str(i) for i in threading.enumerate()]))

        atexit.register(run_on_exit)

        t = threading.Thread(target=test_loop, daemon=True)
        t.start()

        exit()


It always puts `Is alive? 1: True` and `Is alive? 2: True` in the log. The daemonic thread is still alive when atexit is called, even after waiting 10 seconds. Moreover, the list of threads shown by threading.enumerate() shows that *MainThread* is stopped at the time that atexit is called, meaning this daemonic thread outlived the main thread.

My question is, is it safe to rely on daemon threads not being killed until all atexit registered functions have finished, or not? In the example, test_loop will never exit naturally, so I was hoping to be able to pass it a stop signal from the run_on_exit function. But this is only reliable if atexit functions always run before daemon threads are killed.

Problem: The latitude values match perfectly,but the calculated longitude values show a systematic offset of approximately 32 degrees.

1. An issue with the PROJ4 string?
2. A coordinate reference system problem?
3. A units or formatting issue?
4. Something else entirely?

It is easier than I thought, because the format is standardized by [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/), with the body of such blocks parseable by `tomllib` without adding any dependencies.

--------

I have a setup, where an auxiliary build/test script invokes mypy on other scripts. For example consider these example files:

    ==> test_it.py <==
    #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
    # /// script
    # dependencies = [""mypy""]
    # ///

    import sys
    import subprocess

    subprocess.check_call((""mypy"", sys.argv[1]))

    ==> other.py <==
    #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
    # /// script
    # dependencies = [""numpy""]
    # ///

    import numpy
    print(numpy.linspace(1,5,5))

With this setup, `uv run --script other.py` gives the expected output, all is fine. But `uv run --script test_it.py other.py` fails with

    subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '('mypy', 'other.py')' returned non-zero exit status 1.

because the environment of `test_it.py` doesn't know about numpy.

For this specific synthetic case, I could just add `numpy` to the dependencies of `test_it.py`. But `test_it.py` is intended to invoke mypy for *arbitrary* other scripts, so it is not possible to do this in general.

My best idea so far is to create a wrapper script with the same `# /// script` declaration as ""other.py"" and invoke mypy from there, but that would require weird workarounds on its own; I'd either have to parse the `# /// script` block and ensure it lists ""mypy"" as a dependency, or invoke pip before mypy in that wrapper script.

Is there some better way to make mypy interoperable with ""uv run --script""?

Otherwise I think I got my answer.

Consider these constraints:

* My string contains letters `[a-z]` and forward slashes - `/`.
* These can be in any order except the slash cannot be my first or last character.
* I need to split the string into a list of subtrings so that I capture the individual letters except whenever I encounter a slash I capture the two surrounding letters instead.
* Each slash always separates two ""options"" i.e. it has a single letter surrounding it every time.

If I understood [this question & answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25483164/regex-match-but-exclude-character-from-capture-group) correctly RegEx is unable to do this. You can give me pointers, I don't necessarily need the finished code.

Example:

    my_string = 'wa/sunfa/smnl/d'
    
    def magic_functions(input_string: str) -> list:
        ???
        return a_list
    
    print(magic_function(my_string))
    >>> [w], [as], [u], [n], [f], [as], [m], [n], [ld]

My attempt that *works partially* and captures the surrounding letters:

    my_string = 'wa/sunfa/smnl/d'
    
    def magic_function(input_string: str) -> list:
        my_list = []
        for i, character in enumerate(my_string):
            if i + 2 < len(my_string)   # Let's not go out of bounds
                if my_string[i + 1] == '/':
                    my_list.append(character + my_string[i + 2])
    
    print(magic_function(my_string))
    >>> [as], [as], [ld]

I think there should be an `elif` condition but I just can't seem to figure it out. As seen I can find the ""options"" letters just fine but how do I capture the others without duplicates? Alternatively I feel like I should somehow remove the ""options"" letters from the original string and loop over it again? Couldn't figure that one out.

The resulting list order / capture order doesn't matter. For what it's worth it's okay to loop through it as many times as needed.

Suppose we could not find an item which satisfies the predicate. What are the pythonic way(s) to handle this scenario?

I can think of four patterns:
1. Raise an exception
2. Accept a ""default value"" parameter, e.g. `my_dict.get(key, default=0)`
3. Return `None` if not found
4. Return a tuple `(found_item, success)`, where `success` is a boolean which reports whether the item was found

Are any of these options more pythonic than the others? When would I use one over the other? Am I missing other standard patterns?

Note that, my question reaches beyond just the `find` example function. I'm asking more generally, what are the standard python idioms for representing ""failure"". I know other languages have different idioms.

For what it's worth, (4) seems like a variation of (3), in that (4) handles the scenario where, `None` is a valid value of type `T`.",11,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mxrqqy/pythonic_way_to_represent_failures/,False,True,False

Although tree or any other name can be used, is using tree misguiding. 

Because actual presence of tree is checked on a tier which can have a space or True. So current_tier[4] can either be True or a space.

I think the reason above replacement is wrong is None is still a value in a slot. What is checked is if that slot exists.Anyway if the slot exists, it is guaranteed not to have None value since earlier:

        if tree. get_left_child is not None:
            set_tier_map(tree.get_left_child (), current_tier + 1, tier_map)

Example:

    ./myprogram.py <
    a
    b
    c
    ^D
    
    Did you mean to send a,b, and c?   y\n>y


Alternate example:

    cat myinput.txt | ./myprogram.py
    Did you mean to send a,b, and c?   y\n>y


So this of course breaks, since STDIN is closed after it reads the a,b,c input.

Unless there is a way to reopen STDIN  (doubtful) I think what I need it a curses-based approach for the y/n prompt, however I don't want to roll my own curses implementation just for a prompt, and I want my program to behave like a normal program the rest of the time.

Are there any simple curses-based solutions for a prompt like this?


[EDIT]

Apologies for the formatting. Based on the responses I got to my question, I'm guessing this is uncommon enough that there are no common solutions, so I created one.

The following snippet is for anyone who finds this post via web search.   This is just the most basic elements all rolled into one function (in production code, you would want to use a context manager):

    def prompt(msg):
        curses.filter()
        stdscr = curses.initscr()
        curses.noecho()
        curses.cbreak()
        sys.stdout.write(f""{msg} y\\n>\n"")
        with CursesContext() as stdscr:
            k = stdscr.getkey()

I'm trying to create a python text adventure based on the Legacy of Dragonholt board game. Basically, its a collaborative choose your own adventure with character sheets & story flags. Here's a snippet:

[https://imgur.com/a/6cFuU0e](https://imgur.com/a/6cFuU0e)

Since there are 1700 entries, I'm going to encode the game's logic (marking story points, checking conditions..) in a yaml format. Here's my draft:

    1654:
      actions:
      - storypoint.mark(['X1'])
      choices:
      - target: 9943
      - target: 7686
      - condition: active_player.has_skill('stealth')
        target: 8408
    
    3792:
      actions:
      - condition: storypoint['N3']
        action: storypoint.mark(['K6', 'M3'])
        else: 
          action: storypoint.mark(['S2', 'W3'])
      choices:
      - condition: >
          active_player.has_skill('brawling')

          or active_player.has_skill('willpower')
        target: 6899
      - target: 7861  

I'm struggling with the actions and conditions, though. My thought is to run an `eval()` or `exec()` over the condition and action strings, but I try not to use those functions in fear of executing arbitrary strings (plus the whole point of the yaml is to separate code from non-code). I poked around on ChatGPT and other resources for ideas, and several non-code options are typically more verbose (like using a dict like {'function': 'has\_skill', 'arg': 'willpower'}).

Since this is a local project, do I really need to worry about `eval()` or `exec()` in this usecase? or are there smarter methods that avoid those functions? ",6,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mxhwpl/create_python_script_from_choose_your_own/,False,True,False

Made a tool for my team, using a flask app so it pops up in browser on run. It’s essentially a little “downloader” for files we send out frequently.

Before my question, here’s what I’m trying to achieve, in case there’s a totally different way to go about this that I’m missing: I chose in browser because this is for a support team where we mainly are in browser for all tools. So it’s not a full site, it just loads on 127.0.0.1:5000, but then it pulls files from a synced one drive location to display.

The issue I’m hitting is that I’d like to package it no console, but when I tested it I ended up with a stack of instances running in the background because closing the browser tab doesn’t end the program. In addition to being messy, it causes out of date files to display. I added a mutex check, but that doesn’t really solve the lack of graceful exit. So I need a way to end the program within the browser gui. 

I’ll list more details on what I’ve tried, but to tl;dr it early, I’m hoping to get advice on if what I’m trying to do is possible, or if I should just go with one of my backup options, which would be to either set the program to timeout and close the browser after 10 minutes, or abandon the browser and just build a new gui. Any advice on getting what I’ve already tried or alternate options would also be greatly appreciated🙏 this is the last piece of this so I’m really hoping to keep it in browser if possible. 

What I’ve tried so ending the browser ends the program:

1. Heartbeat/watchdog from the browser to the program, if it was more than 45 seconds without a beat it would close. Didn’t work because the browser consistently throttled setInterval after 26 beats so it would then close. Tried setTimeout also, same result. 

2. Exit signal from closing the tab. I used subprocess.Popen to launch the browser as a child and track the process handle, using .wait() to catch the browser close. Couple of issues, 1st, since other people will use, I can’t really use my own file path to a browser exe to launch the child process. So I wanted to try using the default browser. I tried start, shell=True, but that didn’t provide a handle to the actual browser. 

3. I tried adding in a tkinter pop up on browser close to prompt an “are you sure you want to exit” dialogue, but that didn’t work at all.. I was frustrated by this point so maybe I just did it wrong, but it seemed like I couldn’t call the python function to close from the JS. 

It doesn’t seem that crazy to recognize the browser closed and end the program, but it’s turning out to be much more complicated than it sounds! Thanks so much for any assistance!

It overrides the save file every time I save and there's certain variables I want to track and compare between saves.


For instance—

Original save:


Year: 1


Name: Greg


Dogs Pet: 38


Then I continue playing and save again, which overrides the original save.

New save:


Year: 2


Name: Greg


Dogs Pet: 56


I want a way to log the data and put in a chart like:


Year | Dogs Pet


1             38


2             56

I want the chart to update in real time every time I save the game.

I have watchdog installed, along with iBensusan's Real Time File Change Monitor, but it only gives me a notification about what files have been updated (which isn't useful for my purposes). 

I feel like there *has* to be a way to make the automatically updating chart, but it's beyond my current understanding of Python and programming in general.

1mxavos,FlamableMammoth,1755879388.0,3,/r/learnpython/comments/1mxavos/problem_with_pyqtplot/,learnpython,Problem with PyQtPlot,"Hi everyone, 
I've been trying to implement a pyQtPlot in a UI-based application. But somehow I've run out of luck and ideas.
I simply can't display (or at least see) any data in my pqQtPlot. This isn't because data is missing or not being plotted in the chart. The chart simply doesn't display any lines or data points. I know that my data is reaching the graphics widget because the widget itself can export the correct data to a CSV file, which I can read directly or display in a spreadsheet.
Does anyone here have any idea why this isn't working?

I tried different colors, line stiles and data point markers but nothing worked, so I left it as simple as follows for this post.

I broke the Problem down to the following UI Example (which also doesn't plot anything but the Graph UI):

```python
# test_app.py
import sys
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication
import pyqtgraph as pg

uiclass, baseclass = pg.Qt.loadUiType(""test_pyqtplot.ui"")

class MainWindow(uiclass, baseclass):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setupUi(self)
        self.update_plot(   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],  # xAxisValues
                            [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])  # yAxisValues
    
    def update_plot(self, xAxis, yAxis):
        x_range = len(xAxis)
        y_range = len(yAxis)
        self.graphWidget.setBackground('w')                 # White Background
        self.graphWidget.setXRange(0, x_range, padding=0)   # Scaling X/Y to data length
        self.graphWidget.setYRange(0, y_range, padding=0)   # This works (!)
        self.graphWidget.plot( xAxis,
                               yAxis,
                               symbol='o',
                               symbolBrush='r',
                               symbolPen='r',
                               symbolSize=6)

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec()
```

It would expect an output of a very simple plot with a diagonal line:
```ascii
10 |                  *
 9 |                *
 8 |              *
 7 |            *
 6 |          *
 5 |        *
 4 |      *
 3 |    *
 2 |  *
 1 |*
   +---------------------
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
But nothing is printed into the plot. No line, no data point. But if you right click and export as CSV, the data appears correct.

The XML code of my UI is as follows:

First time posting so sorry if my post is not in the format it should be 😅

At work, i've got assigned the task to automate the process of making break glass accounts for different tenants and excluding them from conditional access policies on azure (with code).  
FYI: I'm comfortable enough with python to get the job done programming wise, yet i'm nowhere near being a decent/good developer.  
I just know enough about coding to make something that works.  
  
I've made my solution using python and Powershell.  
  
the script goes like this:  
Python asks the user for the total amount of tenants that will be configured, tenantid, total amount of break glass account.   
Using the [Microsoft.Graph.Authentication Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.authentication/?view=graph-powershell-1.0), I made the connection happen.  
then it will run the first powershell script that will create the x amount of break glass accounts and assign them a password. 

About the passwords, the clients wont afford yubikeys so we made the decision to use 2FA with passwordstate.  
The client will hold the paper with the upn and password and we generate the TOTP.  
(i know that this is not the way Microsoft wants it but leave it out the scope).

After creating the break glass accounts, another powershell script will start and give the break glass accounts temporarily access pass codes, these will substitute for the actual passwords and be enable only for creating the MFA config.

After the break glass accounts get assigned to the conditional access policies as excluded users and the policies are automatically added in Azure.  
  
The problems im facing are the following:  
  
\- Even though this is an internal tool that's just meant to get the job done, its still a firm Im making this for and not a random project.   
\- So currently the break glass account gets made and a password generator generates a password. The problem is, that I dont really know how to keep the password secure.  
Since my colleagues will be using this code (Not even sure if its going to be an executable or through visual studio code itself, they can easily see the value of the password.

\- the thing is that the password is not meant for us to see and only for the clients (since they will be holding onto them).  
This way we kind of hold integrity. (or at least thats what Im trying here with the temp codes etc..)

\- I dont know how to deliver my solution in a way that they cant really reach the Powershell and python scripts itself or see the password, only the things they are meant to see.

\- Im not even sure if python and powershell were the right languagues or if i should've used Golang or something.

\- For security i dont know what the best practices are and if things as obfuscation really help.

This all probably sounds really vague but this is the best way i can describe it.  
Ofcourse im learning yet i feel like i made the most diy solution that just seem to work.

Feel free to ask question, i will try to answer all of them.

`uv tool install --editable .` does the same as `pipx install -e .` - installs the scripts and adds a link in ~/.local/bin.

`uv pip install -e .` does similar, but add them to the `project/.venv/bin` which is likely not in your path, so if you go that way, you'd need to add it to your path.

Thanks folks!

--

I have an existing project in a folder `jdcli` - a bunch of handy python commands I use as my own personal command line interface things.  E.g. I have a wrapper for various `yt-dlp` things I call `vrip`. There is a `pyproject.toml`, and it defines the commands, e.g.:

```
[project.scripts]
vrip = ""vrip.cli:cli""
blackhole = ""blackhole.cli:blackhole""
music = ""music.cli:cli""
check = ""check.cli:cli""
```

If I use `pipx install -e ~/jdcli` - the project & dependencies are then installed in editable mode, and subsequently I can then call my commands directly from the shell - `vrip some_url`.  If I make changes to the source code, this is immediately reflected when I run things.  I do have to reinstall with `--force` if I add a new command (script).

I am trying to find a `uv` equivalent (because `uv` is so damn fast!).

I can install the project with `uv pip install -e ~/jdcli` and then I can run the commands with `uv run vrip etc` - which is fine, I guess, but I miss that direct access!  I could alias `uv run vrip` to just `vrip`...but I feel like I am missing something and there should be a more direct equivalent from `uv` for this.  I feel like it should be `uv tool install -e ~/jdcli` or similar, but it seems `uv tool` only looks for tools in a package index?

I'm only just starting with `uv` (and am not that great with Python packaging in general!) - so I might be missing something here, but if there is an equivalent I'd like to know it.

I have been teaching myself Python over the past few years while I finished my finance degree. Now that I’ve graduated, I wanted to test what I’ve learned. I combined two things I enjoy, reinforcement learning and board games, and built an AlphaZero-style training system for the board game Hnefatafl. 

Here is my code: [https://github.com/nicholasg1997/hnefatafl/tree/experimental](https://github.com/nicholasg1997/hnefatafl/tree/experimental)

This is my first time sharing my code publicly, and I still feel very much like an amateur despite lots of reading and practice, so I am a bit nervous. I’d really appreciate any feedback, positive or negative. I know my code is missing some crucial things, like better documentation and type hints, and I will make a better habit of including these in the future. 

The foundation of my project was based on “Deep Learning and the Game of Go,” but I had to make plenty of adjustments to handle Hnefatafl. To be fully transparent, I did occasionally use ChatGPT to get unstuck and help me with areas I didn’t fully understand, but I attempted to keep its use to a minimum. 

So far, I haven’t seen much success in training a capable model. I am not sure if this is from a problem with my implementation or if it’s just limited compute - I am training on a MacBook Air, so I have to keep the search depth low and can only do a few games per generation before my computer overheats. 

Any feedback would mean a lot and is appreciated. Long term, I’d love to move towards work in quant finance or machine learning (self-driving cars, etc.), but for now, I am just focused on improving.

Greetings,

I am trying to impelment the web crawler code in CS101 of professor Evans. But i met some problems, most urls I found are having normal format except for some are not.

I am using ""<a href="" to find the start of a link, and /"" as the end of a link. For example, if for

`http://www.asofterworld.com/archive.php'>archives</a></li>...`

The link should be ""[https://what-if.xkcd.com](https://what-if.xkcd.com/)"". But I found some urls are so strange, for example, one url as below. After it used the double quote to start the url, it added a lot of strange strings until the next quote, so the link looks so strange.

My guess is that some web urls are using some anti-crawler techniques. But it's a problem for people like me try to do some Python projects from the course. What should I do next?

So I've developed a little piece of software that I use quite a lot at work. It works just fine at the moment, but it's an eyesore, not very robust and quite limited, so I've decided I want to rebuild it from scratch, taking on board what I learned the first time.

Very briefly, the application actually consists of two programs. The first takes a jpg image and adds text on top of it. This part works really well and I'm not going to touch it much. The second application, the one I'm rebuilding, is an editor that lets you change the template for what text and where it gets added by the first application.

The editor is currently built using mainly tkinter, and I'm finding it quite limiting. First of all I don't believe there is a way to trigger a function when a text field is typed into. I'm also struggling whenever I want to open subwindows, or have the menu change dynamically. Ideally, I want the whole package to be a menu bar app, with three options: ""convert images"", ""edit template"", and ""settings"", but I found a lot of troubles using tkinter with rumps.

My thinking now is to use PyGame to build the editor from scratch. I've got some experience with the library already, and I know it will give me the flexibillity I need, but I'm also aware I will need to reinvent the wheel several times just to create things tkinter already has. Should I stick with tkinter?

And the program crashes. 

How would I ***efficiently*** handle these cases? Since I'm providing a set number of column headers the program crashes with

pandas.errors.ParserError: Expected 11 fields in line 160124, saw 22. Error could possibly be due to quotes being ignored when a multi-char delimiter is used. 

This is what the code looks like: 

    def bird_reader_df(file_path: str, timezone = None, headerarg=None, separg=None, *args, **kwargs) -> pd.DataFrame:
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep=separg, header=headerarg)
        df.to_datetime([headerarg[0], headerarg[1], headerarg[2], headerarg[3], headerarg[4],     headerarg[5]])
        return df
    
    #testing method
    col_names = ['year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'count']
    df_test = bird_reader_df(""Pe Pro/Data Science Projects/DS Repo/bird_jan25jan16.txt"", header=col_names, separg=r""[-:.\s]+"")
    print(df_test)

I know I could first load the lines into a list and split them that way and then convert into a DataFrame, but from what I understand lists don't scale well due to lack of vectorization so I'd like to learn how to handle this efficiently.

I built an **asynchronous media processing API** and would appreciate feedback on my code organization and some specific implementation patterns.

# What it does

An API that accepts image generation requests and processes them asynchronously in the background. Users submit a prompt, get a job ID, then poll for results. Built with:

* **FastAPI** for the REST API
* **Celery** for background task processing
* **PostgreSQL** for job tracking
* **Redis** as message broker
* **S3** for file storage
* **Docker** for easy setup

It's a relatively simple project (\~1000 lines), but I tried to structure it like a real-world service with proper separation of concerns.

# The backstory

Built this as a coding challenge to demonstrate async API patterns and clean code organization.

# What I'm specifically looking for feedback on:

* **Database session management** \- How I handle SQLAlchemy sessions across API and Celery workers
* **Package/module organization** \- Does the folder structure and separation make sense?
* **FastAPI patterns** \- Dependency injection, error handling, response models
* **General code quality** \- Anything that stands out as poorly done or could be improved

# Key aspects:

Async request/response pattern with job polling  
Modular structure with separate packages for media, tasks, core  
Error handling and logging throughout  
Complete test coverage  
Docker setup for local development

# Repository

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/Trinkes/jobs\_media\_processing](https://github.com/Trinkes/jobs_media_processing)

The README has complete setup instructions - you can get it running locally with just `docker compose up`.

Thanks for taking a look!

Lately I’ve been feeling a little stuck and didn’t really have anyone to talk to about this, so I thought I’d ask here.

I want to develop myself in robotics, machine learning, and AI, but I haven’t started university yet (I’ll be starting my Electronics bachelor’s in Germany soon). Right now, I only have basic Python knowledge (OOP, JSON, APIs, and I’ve done a few small data automation projects). I think I’m at a level where I could branch into different directions. I’ve never worked with Raspberry Pi or Arduino, and my math knowledge isn’t fully ready for the ML side of things yet.

I also haven’t worked with ROS, but I’ve read through this [Articulated Robotics guide](https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/tutorials/ready-for-ros/ros-overview/) and even took some personal notes.

The point is: I’ve been researching for a while, but I think the best thing is to ask for advice from people with more experience.

So here’s my question:  
Should my next step be to get a Raspberry Pi kit and start building projects, or should I focus more on Python with datasets, OpenCV, and Machine Learning for now? I know I’ll need to improve my math for ML anyway. Both paths don’t seem “wrong,” they just feel like two different approaches.

For context: I want to improve myself in these areas both for now and for the future. I find building and designing things fun and interesting. Learning Python and making projects was fun, but after a while my motivation dropped because I didn’t really know what I was aiming for. Maybe Raspberry Pi projects could help me keep my interests alive in the short term, while in the long term I’d love to do more research and bigger projects in robotics/AI. I don’t know if I’ll ever get the chance to work at a company like Figure AI, but either way I’d like to keep progressing.

That’s pretty much it. If you have advice, a potential roadmap, or even tutorials you’d recommend, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks!",4,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mvp96g/feeling_lost_on_my_learning_pathneed_guidance/,False,True,False

My question for this Reddit thread is whether there are any Python courses that are truly worthwhile. I have been programming in R and Python for about five years, but all of my learning has been self-taught. The issue is that, when it comes to listing it on my resume, I don’t have any course that is genuinely worth including as formal proof of my Python skills.

It may sound unfortunate, but the reality is that the job market often works in such a way that if you don’t have a certification or diploma, employers may overlook you. For that reason, I would like to ask: what are the best Python courses out there, or the ones with the greatest recognition in your company, your country, or simply those you personally know to be valuable?

I want to create an app that opens a single window with two plots in it: one that is a rendering of a 3D mesh and the other that is an x-y plot.  The window would also have a slider control and maybe a few other elements, like check boxes or radio buttons.  If the slider is adjusted, the plots would need to be updated.

I tried Open3D, which is great for the 3D mesh, but doesn't seem to be good for the other stuff.  I tried MatPlotLib, which worked well for getting the two plots and slider control, but evidently it doesn't use GPU acceleration so is very slow in drawing a 3D mesh - one that Open3D renders very quickly.

Is there a more appropriate GUI for this type of app?  Something that will render 3D meshes fast (say 1e6 triangles) and let me have multiple plots and controls in one window?  Jupyter maybe?

I've been banging my head against a problem for a day or two.  When I run a curses program, there's no output until a key is pressed.  I'm baffled as to why this would be as there's no calls to getch() until after both windows have been drawn.  I did dutifully call refresh() on each window as well as stdscr.

Forgive the object oriented-ness of the example.  It was, for me anyway, the only way to make it not look like spaghetti.  There might be some cruft from attempts to figure out the issue as well.

This is supposed to put two windows on the screen.  A username is displayed on the left window and the user is supposed to choose a corresponding username in the right side window.  It works great except there's no output until a key is pressed.  I don't want to use nodelay(True) because it really doesn't need to be consuming cpu cycles while waiting for input.

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Edit: tried to fix formatting of the code.

Update: I fixed it after making a VERY slight modification.  I turned on stdscr.window.nodelay() in the initialization function and then turned it back off in the top of the stdscr.run\_menu() function.  I also removed a duplicate clear call that didn't need to be in there and I optimized the while loop.  Runs great now.  Just wish that bug were documented somewhere...

Update 2: The order of the initialization calls matters.  Been working on this across Windows, Linux, and OSX and all of them behave the same.  Init looks like this now:

       def initialize(self, stdscr):
          self.window = stdscr
          self.window.clear()
          self.window.refresh()
          self.window.nodelay(True)

I have been working on a robotics project for much of that time utilizing ChatGPT to learn/make up for my dificiencies in coding.

As background to this question, my issue involves robot to robot (Pololu bots with a 3pi+ 2040 OLED) communcaiton over MQTT. The robots communicate over MQTT via esp32s that are wired to the Pololus UART. I have verified that the esp32 is properly forwarding messages to the Pololu by hooking into its serial and printing the payloads being forwarded. I have had this working for a long time, however to optimize memory, I am trying to switch from decoding and adding to a string buffer, to trying to use a byte array (which I will eventually make a set size). I am also trying to use a thread for processing UART communication for the first time. The attached code is a test script I wrote to try to troubleshoot the issue. I have also included a screeen shot of the serial going from the esp32 to the Pololu. The payload is printed uon reciving from MQTT then printed piecemeal as it is relayed over UART. I will also include my esp32 code. I have been troubleshooting using light flashes to see where my code is getting hung up. Example messages are in black comment in the troubleshooting code.

I am having 2 issues. First, the delimited (which is a dash -) is not able to be indexed. I started with ord('-'), which should index its given number (I think 42), this threw an exception. I then changed it to b'-' or '-' just to see what happened and this gave me a valueerror. The second issue is that after I get this error, the flash activating flags should reset and I should get the saem error when there is more UART messages available. However, it appears that the thread drops dead because I see no more flashes after the intial set, indicating that the Pololu is not longer processing UART.

Sorry for my lack of technical language and scattered description. Any help or corrections would be greatly appreciated.

Angela Yu's first lessons seem to suggest this kind of recursive approach to repeating scripts, which I found very clever in the beginning.

Today, while debugging a logical flaw I had while trying to abuse recursion (I found the problem eventually), thanks to ChatGPT I learned about the **recursion limit** and the concept of a **call stack that keeps growing**.

At this point I would like to know the opinion of more experienced programmers on stuff like this.

Should I still use recursion this way? And if yes, what are the cases in which it is acceptable or even suggested? 

Should I not do it at all and learn the (ChatGPT-suggested) best practice of using a while loop instead, and using break to exit it when needed?

Should I not care too much because going forward in my lessons I'm about to learn something that will make this completely useless/obsolete?

Something else I'm not considering?

I hold a diploma in Biology and a degree in Physics (in the latter I took two courses on simulation of physical systems in C). In 2015, after I graduated, I completed the following courses while studying to be a high school teacher:

* MITx Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
* MITx Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
* HarvardX Matrix Algebra and Linear Models
* HarvardX Statistics and R for the Life Sciences
* Johns Hopkins University The Data Scientist's Toolbox
* Johns Hopkins University R Programming

However, I have never worked as a programmer, but rather as a high school science teacher. Last year, seeking a change, I took a couple of Java courses, and this year I finished *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*.

I’m not entirely sure which field of programming I want to pursue (automation, algorithms, data science, development…), so I’d like to keep learning and trying different areas while looking for a job.

I enjoyed AtBS because it combines theory and practice, so I’m looking for a book that does the same—or perhaps a mix of books to cover those fields. I know a common piece of advice is to build your own projects, but I don’t yet feel mentally ready for that. I’m self-taught and motivated, but I prefer a structured program.

Some thoughts and questions:

* Is it worth taking a look at *Python Crash Course* after *AtBS*?
* How about combining *Beyond the Basic Stuff* with a project book by Al, like *The Big Book of Small Python Projects*?
* I think *Fluent Python*, while highly recommended, might be too advanced for me. Maybe *Effective Python* instead?
* Should I go wild and try Godot?

It can be used as source data for businesses and other points of interest to improve [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) so that's why I started contributing. It's a good project to gather high-quality data so that places around the world are more discoverable by more people. The tags in OSM also can feature a lot more detail about a place than Google Maps like the kinds of goods a store sells, payment methods, whether or not there's parking, etc.

It's been great practice for using regex, dictionaries and lists, string manipulation tasks, as well as loops, control structures and exception handling. There's a ton of examples in the repo so if I have an issue and want to see how others solved it I can search through the code on Github, and see how others did a specific task. I've learned a lot of cool tricks so far but I have a lot more to learn, especially when it comes to using Playwright (a web browser control engine like Selenium) and parsing HTML. I've been focused on JSON parsing since it's really easy and a lot of brands use it to store their store data.

Another beginner-friendly trait is that you don't have to understand the entire codebase at first, but as you interact with the different templates and helper code you can go in and see how it works.

I’ve been working with FastAPI and .NET Web API for a while, and recently I started learning Django REST Framework. I’m trying to wrap my head around how serialization works across these frameworks but finding similarities. Here’s my current understanding:

* Django REST Framework: You define a Model for the database and then a separate Serializer class that knows how to translate between the object model and JSON. Serializers also handle validation and relationships.
* FastAPI: Uses Pydantic models both for validation and serialization. If you use SQLAlchemy for the DB layer, you typically convert to a Pydantic model before returning JSON. Basically, Pydantic covers what Django splits into Models + Serializers.
* .NET Web API: You just return a C# class object, and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) automatically serializes it to JSON using System.Text.Json (or Newtonsoft if configured). Attributes can control naming, but there’s no dedicated serializer class like in Django.

So in short:

* Django = Model + Serializer
* FastAPI = Pydantic model (all-in-one)
* .NET = Plain C# class auto-serialized

Need help regarding tiers. After a dictionary is generated that includes all the nodes by calling set_tier_map function, another dictionary named tiers is created initialized to empty dictionary. 

So tiers term is used twice. First as an argument of set_tier_map function while calling it. Second time as a new dictionary created with empty value. 

I understand both these are not related. Inside argument instead of tiers, any other name would have the same outcome. 

But when sorted with:

        for key in sorted(tiers,reverse=False):

Which tiers is being referred to? It cannot be the empty tiers dictionary created. So will it have the values resulting from calling set_tier_map function using (self, 0, tiers) as argument. And is it that on subsequent operations the third argument tiers can be used for further processes by denoting it as tiers? But then there are two tiers and so it will help to have clarification.

This is the code I'm using. The for loop does not seem like it's iterating through the result like I pictured.

    from lxml import etree
    
    file = ""xml_test.xml""
    
    tree = etree.parse(file)
    root = tree.getroot()
    print(root)
    
    node = root.xpath(""//packagedElement[@name='Abstract Resource Information']/packagedElement"")
    print(len(node))
    for child in node:
        print(node[child].attrib['name'])
    

But it gives me this error

>print(node\[child\].attrib\['name'\])  
\~\~\~\~\^\^\^\^\^\^\^  
TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not lxml.etree.\_Element

I know I'm on the right path because when I specify the array position

    node = root.xpath(""//packagedElement[@name='Abstract Resource Information']/packagedElement"",namespaces = ns)
    print(len(node))
    for child in node:
        print(node[0].attrib['name'])

I get the element printed out

I would like to create a diagram with time of day on the x-axis. In the diagram, I want to represent different kinds of events:

1. Point in time – e.g., when a patient takes medication. Ideally shown with an icon or marker.
2. State change of a discrete property – e.g., symptoms changing from severe to moderate. This could be shown as a step graph or as colored bars.
3. State (without a known change time) – e.g., a patient reports their symptoms are severe, but it’s not known when it started.

There may be several records of each category.

The goal with the visualization is to reveal patterns, such as:

* How long after medication do symptoms improve?
* Does this timing differ depending on whether the medication is taken before or after a meal?

I also want to:

* Include data from multiple days in the same diagram.
* Be able to adjust content and layout fairly easily

I’m running into a strange issue when using [Astral’s UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) with Docker + Gunicorn.

# The problem

When I run my Flask app in Docker with `uv run gunicorn ...`, refreshing the page several times (or doing a hard refresh) causes Gunicorn workers to timeout and crash with this error:

After that, a new worker boots, but the same thing happens again.

# What’s weird

* If I run `uv run` [`main.py`](http://main.py) directly (no Docker), it works perfectly.
* If I run the app in Docker **without uv** (just Python + Gunicorn), it also works fine.
* The error only happens inside Docker + uv + Gunicorn.
* Doing a **hard refresh** (clear cache and refresh) on the site always triggers the issue.

# My Dockerfile (problematic)

    FROM python:3.13.6-slim-bookworm
    
    COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/
    WORKDIR /app
    ADD . /app
    
    RUN uv sync --locked
    
    EXPOSE 8080
    CMD [""uv"", ""run"", ""gunicorn"", ""--bind"", ""0.0.0.0:8080"", ""main:app""]

# Previous Dockerfile (stable, no issues)

    FROM python:3.13.6-slim-bookworm
    
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    COPY ./requirements.txt .
    
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    COPY . .
    
    EXPOSE 8080
    CMD [""gunicorn"", ""--bind"", ""0.0.0.0:8080"", ""main:app""]

# Things I tried

* Using `CMD [""/app/.venv/bin/gunicorn"", ""--bind"", ""0.0.0.0:8080"", ""main:app""]` → same issue.
* Creating a **minimal Flask app** → same issue.
* Adding `.dockerignore` with `.venv` → no change.
* Following the [official uv-docker-example](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example) → still same issue.

# Environment

* Windows 11
* uv 0.8.11 (2025-08-14 build)
* Python 3.13.6
* Flask 3.1.1
* Gunicorn 23.0.0 (default sync worker)

**Question:**  
Has anyone else run into this with uv + Docker + Gunicorn? Could this be a uv issue, or something in Gunicorn with how uv runs inside Docker?

Thanks!

Edit: It turns out that error happens even without uv. So, when i added these gunicorn commands (--timeout 120 and --keep-alive 2), after a long wait on refresh the page actually loads with no error.

Here's what I've got so far:

`from itertools import permutations`  
`def middle_permutation(chars):`  
`# create a list of permutations`  
`p = [''.join(x) for x in permutations(''.join(sorted(chars)))]`  
`# return the middle string`  
`return (p[len(p)//2 - 1]) if len(p) % 2 == 0 else (p[len(p)//2])`

It tests strings like: ""abc"", ""abcd"", ""abcdx"", ""cxgdba"", ""dczxgba"" and returns the ""middle"" permutation. Using the first example:  
`input: 'abc' => permutations: ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']`  
`function returns ==> 'bac'`

The code above passes the basic ""Tests"" but fails the later attempts due to timing out. From my own testing in PyCharm, it runs in 0.7 seconds with a string of 10 characters but 7 seconds with 11 characters, essentially an order of magnitude more for each character added.

I’m building an app where users can create and track milestones. I had an idea to make this process easier by adding an **AI feature that generates milestone details** from a user’s prompt (and optionally an image).

Here’s the flow I want:

* User enters a prompt (like *“Create a milestone for building a React Native login screen”*)
* AI model processes it and returns structured output (title, description, date, etc.)
* These fields automatically populate in the milestone form on the frontend
* User can review/edit → then hit **Create Milestone** → which saves to the backend

The problem I’m facing:

* I tried connecting to Hugging Face API, but I keep running into **403 errors (forbidden)**.
* I’m not sure what’s the best free/affordable way to let users generate this kind of milestone content **without paying heavy API costs**.
* I also want to make this deliverable for a client project, so I need something reliable and cost-efficient.

**My stack:** React Native frontend + Node.js/Express backend.

Has anyone here implemented something similar?

* Should I stick with Hugging Face or look into OpenAI alternatives?
* Is there any workaround for free tier limitations (while still being able to ship it to clients)?
* Would it be better to run a lightweight open-source model locally on the server (so no recurring costs)?

Processors act on simple data structures called ""blocks"". A block must obey a simple contract: be a pydantic's `BaseModel` and has a `timestamp` attribute.

Other devs will implement concrete blocks and processors. To each their own.

I am trying to define a generic type, such that our typechecker can check if an object inherits from pydantic's `BaseModel` and has a `timestamp` attribute. Can't figure out how...

I have a an abstract class operating on a generic data structure (""blocks""):

    class BlockProcessor(Generic[T], abc.ABC):
    
      def process(self, block: T) -> T:
      ...

A ""block"" and their processor implementation is up to other devs, but the block must:

\- Be a `Pydantic.BaseModel` child  
\- Have a `timestamp: str` attribute

e.g.

    class MyBlock(BaseModel):
      """"""Correct, typechecker should not raise any issue""""""
      timestamp: str
      data: list[int]
    
    class MyBlock(BaseModel):
      """"""Incorrect because of missing timestamp attr""""""
      data: list[int]
    
    class MyBlock:
      """"""Incorrect because not a child of BaseModel""""""
      timestamp: str
      data: list[int]

I need the type checker to warn other devs when implementing blocks and processor:

    class MyProcessor(BlockProcessor[MyBlock]):
      def process(self, block: MyBlock) -> MyBlock:
        return block

What did'nt work:

I've tried defining a Protocol with a `timestamp` attribute, but then I'm missing the `BaseModel` inheritance:

    class _TimeStampProtocol(Protocol):
      timestamp: str
      T = TypeVar(""T"", bound=_TimeStampProtocol) # ensures has a timestamp, but missing BaseModel inheritance

I've tried defining a Pydantic model with a `timestamp` attribute, but then developpers need to inherit from the child model rather than `BaseModel`:

    class _TimeStampModel(BaseModel):
      timestamp: str
    T = TypeVar(""T"", bound=_TimeStampModel) # ensures has a timestamp, but forces concrete blocks to inherit from TimeStampModel rather than BaseModel

I've tried defining a more complex object with Protocol and BaseModel inheritance, but this is not allowed by our typechecker (pyright) which then fails:

    class _TimeStampModel(BaseModel, Protocol): # This is straight up not allowed
      timestamp: str
    T = TypeVar(""T"", bound=_TimeStampModel)

Not sure how to proceed further. It seems like my contraints are pretty simple:

\- Concrete data structure must be a BaseModel and must have a timestamp attribute. The concrete block should directly subclass BaseModel such as to avoid inheriting from the lib's private objects.

\- Devs should not have to worry about checking for this at runtime, our typechecker should let them know if any implementation is wrong.

It is student variable or argument that makes get_name function work properly as part of sorted function.

I'm trying to create a python script in order to interact with a couple sensor devices, that collect data and transmit it back to my computer.  
Each device is repressented with a class object on my program, and each object holds a queue (handled by a thread) for function execution and a socket(one socket for each device)for data/command transfering. Most if not all of the functions use the socket to transfer data.  
A typical flow of the program is that i send an acquisition command to each of my devices to start storing data, poll for the done status and once all of the are done, i send the command to retrieve the data through the socket. The thing is that i sometimes get a socket timeout error on one or more devices (the device which happens is not always the same) during the first retrieve function execution of the script. If i rerun the script the problem seems to be fixed.  
The commands for each device are enqueued on the thread worket/queue for each object in the main and i've also tried to use locks on the socket connection. Last but not least i tried to retrieve data from a single device, thinking that it was some kind of race condition that i hadn't though of, but the problem still persisted.

• Smooth 150-ticker updates without touching the live data pipeline

**Tkinter fixes I’m considering**  
• Coalesce per-ticker updates… render only the latest  
• Process a small batch per frame with `after(0)`  
• Round-robin WARPLAN rebuilds instead of full sweeps  
• Move prev-close and daily volume into worker caches… UI reads only  
• Throttle quote refreshes with a short cooldown  
• Quiet hot-path logs… buffer any CSV writes  
• Tune thread pool and add backpressure  
• Apply table changes in batches… sort once at the end

**Your call**  
If you were me… would you tune Tkinter or just move on? If you were to move on, what would be your suggestion?

Has anyone had Tkinter performance issues?

It seems like every time I try to upgrade the performance its a complete beating. The GUI has been one of the hardest parts of this project for me..

I'd like to develop software that will:  
\- read dimensions from a technical drawing in PDF/DWG/DXF format (reading the length and width of a part from the dimension line for a given item) + read the material grade (from the assembly table),  
\- then, based on boundary conditions, the program will determine which part will be laser-processed (thickness < 25 mm) or plasma-processed (> 25 mm < 100 mm) + whether or not it will be a bent element.  
  
I've seen that Python can do this. The biggest problem is how the program will find the dimensions and determine the dimensions: length x width. The drawing has many dimension lines. While the grade is usually listed in the table in the lower right corner, the dimensions are arranged differently. I'd appreciate any advice on how to approach this.",0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mryxyw/algorithm_for_automatic_reading_of_dimensions/,False,True,False

The function of remove\_person\_from\_room to me seems clunky - but I do not know if there is any better way to handle finding what current ROOM a PERSON is located in,  in order to then remove them from it before adding them to another room (as seen in the last two lines of code as an example for the person Matt). The game moves people around a text adventure map (which has rooms like a house) based on certain events that occur at times based on a clock. remove\_person\_from\_room therefore is called many times in the rest of the code. Maybe this is the best way? Thank you for reading.",2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mrncc0/expert_advice_or_critique_regarding_how_this_code/,False,True,False

I am trying to build a standalone python, so I can add to my electron app for it to execute python scripts, something like apps like blender does. I know there is an existing repo called astral-sh/python-build-standalone ,but there are problems with tkinter script execution on intel based mac when packaged with electron-builder.

Which is why I want to build a standalone python myself. I tried a quite a bit using bash scripts to download and build it. But the problem was it worked on my system, but failed to in another system because some of the paths only existed in my system.

So does anyone know how to build a truely standalone python, without dependencies to paths on the system.

_SCALARS = (str, int, float, bool, type(None))

class Shaper:
    '''
    Deterministic, value-safe structural summarizer for Python objects.

    Produces a bounded, reproducible string representation of a data structure’s
    shape without exposing values. Useful for logging, debugging, and type-shape
    inspection.

    Properties:
    - Deterministic: ordering is stable via heapq.nsmallest and sorted unions.
    - Bounded: Limits processing and output to *max_items* per container level.
    - Value-safe: never includes raw data values.

    Parameters:
    - max_items: int – limit on sampled keys/elements per container.
    - preserve_keys: bool – whether to show literal keys in mapping shapes.
    - allow_missing_in_list_dict: bool – enable special-case list[dict] key-union output.

    Example:
    >>> Shaper().shape(['a', 'b'])
    'list[str]'
    >>> Shaper().shape({'a': [1, 2]})
    'dict[str -> list[int]]'
    >>> Shaper(preserve_keys=False).shape({'x': 1, 'y': 's'})

I’m a recent CS grad with prior data science experience, and I’m currently working on a healthcare AI project while job hunting. My role so far has shifted away from pure data work and into developing AI agents, building ML models, and writing Python code.

Funny thing is, during uni and internships, coding wasn’t my strongest area. But now that I’m in the thick of it, I’ve found I actually enjoy it — so I’m doubling down on learning.

My approach right now:
	•	Reverse-engineering example code from projects
	•	Mapping out the structure and flow before I write my own
	•	Researching libraries, frameworks, and models as needed
	•	Building my own versions from scratch for practice
	•	Leaning on AI coding agents when I hit a gap in my knowledge (e.g., for parts of a transcription app I’m building for a ministry)

I’d like to level up my skills so I can go from “getting things working” to writing clean, efficient, production-ready code.

For those with more experience:
	•	How would you refine or improve my current learning process?
	•	Any specific projects, habits, or resources that really helped you make that leap?

Thank you very much for your replies!!

I'm new to programming, so I decided to learn Python through MOOC.FI. I'm loving the course, but my code often diverges greatly from the solution you see after completing the exercises. Is this a bad thing??

For example:

`days = int(input(""How many days? ""))`  
`I just multiply the number entered by 86400`  
`result = 86400 * days`

`print(f""Seconds in that many days: {result}"")`

This is my code.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is the model solution:

    how_many = input(""How many days? "")
    
    days = int(how_many)
    
    seconds = days * 24 * 60 * 60
    
    print(f""Seconds in that many days: {seconds}"")

Just wanted to share this. I think it’s the first time I’ve use a `match case` statement and actually felt like it was a decent use.

This thing just polls one of those API endpoints that works asynchronously.

If you’re like me and haven’t started using match statements yet, I bet you’ll think this is neat.",2,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mqaf2g/example_use_of_match_case_with_api_polling/,False,True,False

so for example. input number, start from input then calculate to 0m using speed. i used the function time to do this. but then i get the program counting backwards in seconds. which takes real seconds to get backwards. but that is of course not what i want.

i want it to calculate as fast as possible. input number, have python calculate it as fast as possible to 0. then explain to me how many seconds or nano seconds it took to get to 0.

i can program it forwards from 0 to 50, but not backwards. or maybe i think to difficult. also is there a module / library or function that works with lightspeed in python?

[`Ki1103`](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ki1103/)

`This seems cool, however I'm not 100% sure what you're actually trying to do. I'm assuming that you've got a .xml file and want to convert it to a json file, while doing some kind of operation on it (this is the part I don't get)?`

Its a bit more complicated than that.

If you create a playlist in iTunes and export it, everything is packaged as an XML file.  
All Artists, Albums, Tracks, and Playlists are included in that single file.

iTunes creates a unique integer value for every song in your library.

    <key>Track ID</key><integer>12859</integer>
    <key>Name</key><string>California Dreamin'</string>
    ((Other Track Information Below In Array))

So, when a playlist is created, it merely lists those integers in an array; your playlist.

    <dict>  
    <key>Name</key><string>BeachDay</string>  
    <key>Description</key><string></string>  
    <key>Playlist ID</key><integer>37080</integer>  
    <key>Playlist Persistent ID</key<string>3904F423CE17F6E8</string>  
    <key>Parent Persistent ID</key><string>D38E87CCA796B383</string>  
    <key>All Items</key><true/>  
    <key>Playlist Items</key>  
    <array>  
    <dict>  
    <key>Track ID</key><integer>12859</integer>  
    </dict>  
    <dict>  
    <key>Track ID</key><integer>1370</integer>  
    </dict>  
    </array>

Sony Music Center does not create a single library file.  
Instead, it makes three separate JSON formatted files.  
These files are: artists.db, tracks.db, and playlists.db

When music files are imported into SMC, it creates an ID for a song in tracks.db

    {""$$date"":1191802816000},
    ""size"":3762176,
    ""uri"":""C:\\Users\\REDACTED\\Music
    \\Mamas and the Papas
    \\Best of The Mamas and the Papas_ 20th Century Masters
    \\1-01 California Dreamin'.mp3"",

((Skipped a bunch of other non-relevant track information))

    ""_id"":""z7lj2hjG1hUzAsV7"",

And if a playlist is made in SMC, it creates them in playlists.db in this format.

    {
    ""title"":""BeachDay"",
    ""sorting"":""B e a c h D a y"",
    ""sourceUri"":""********-****-****-****-************"",
    ""coverArts"":[],
    ""_id"":""j6kRYo2uIMSfaT3h"",
    ""createdAt"":{""$$date"":1754530893894},
    ""updatedAt"":{""$$date"":1754531006999},
    ""_trackIds"":[""z7lj2hjG1hUzAsV7"",""yIgFVBfokDZZeo5A""],
    ""_tags"":[]
    }

So, I need to:

1. Index all Playlists from Library.xml,
2. Index all the song names in those playlists from the integer value
3. Reference the unique track IDs in tracks.db from the song names
4. Create a playlist using the format above.

Anyways, on my terminal it says ""Traceback (most recent call last): File ""main-py"", line 8 SyntaxError: 'return' outside function"", but I'm unsure what could be causing a traceback within my code. It seems like anywhere within the if statement, typing return True has a Syntax error anyway. Unsure if I should avoid adding return, but still would need to return a True or False value anyway. 

The lines of code that I have added for step 41(problem set) were the if statement through the print('space!'). It does mention print(char == ' '), which I have removed and implemented for the if loop. The if and else statement has the colons attached. Indentation doesn't seem to be off. The if and else statements are aligned. If anyone could help, I would be greatly appreciate.

However, I want to also have this be potential summarize that information into a paragraph(ie...reads the article and provides a summary). In the efforts I have made, I have failed.

we did that and sure enough python works now in the command shell.

however when install something like pip install numpy for example.

i get the message that it is installed but path is wrong.

so what i get from that, is that we actually installed another python from the windows store.

my question is when the 3.13.6 was installed on this computer with windows11 before the windows store, why is it not possible to run python commands in CMD right then?

i would expect it would work the same as on my computer.

and the question is how do i install packages for python 3.13.6 if i can not run python from CMD?

I am trying to understand how they work and first solve the exercises and then look at the model solutions. The model solutions sometimes differ from the code i wrote, and i have now found an model solution where i can't wrap my head around how it works. 

This is for exercise ""PIN and number of attempts"", with this description:

""Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is *4321*. The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.""

In the model solution right after the first ""break"" they write the print(""Wrong"") I don't get why it's there in that spot in the while loop.

The thought that i have is that because it is a ""while True"" loop is that anything False will trigger that print. Should i see this as an ""else"" statement, but really short using the True/False as a trigger?

  
This my solution:

    att=0
    while True:
        pin=int(input(""PIN:""))
        att+=1
        if pin==4321 and att==1:

I have a pretty general question about best practices in regards to **creating ETL pipelines with python**. My usecase is pretty simple - download big chunks of data (at least 1 GB or more), decompress it, validate it, compress it again, upload it to S3. Now my initial though was doing asyncio for downloading > asyncio.queue > multiprocessing > asyncio.queue > asyncio for uploading to S3. However it seems that this would cause a lot of pickle serialization to/from multiprocessing which doesn't seem the best idea.Besides that I thought of the following:  


* multiprocessing shared memory - if I read/write from/to shared memory in my asyncio workers it seems like it would be a blocking operation and I would stop downloading/uploading just to push the data to/from multiprocessing. That doesn't seem like a good idea.
* writing to/from disk (maybe use mmap?) - that would be 4 operations to/from the disk (2 writes and 2 reads each), isn't there a better/faster way?
* use only multiprocessing - not using asyncio could work but that would also mean that I would ""waste time"" not downloading/uploading the data while I do the processing although I could run another async loop in each individual process that does the up- and downloading but I wanted to ask here before going down that rabbit hole :))
* use multithreading instead? - this can work but I'm afraid that the decompression + compression will be much slower because it will only run on one core. Even if the GIL is released for the compression stuff and downloads/uploads can run concurrently it seems like it would slower overall.

I'm also open to picking something else than Python if another language has better tooling for this usecase, however since this is a general high IO + high CPU usage workload that requires sharing memory between processes I can imagine it's not the easiest on any runtime. ",3,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1monu5x/whats_the_best_way_to_process_data_in_a_python/,False,True,False

Instead, the NAs are silently converted to `True`. This is because `bool(np.NaN)` equals `True`, as opposed to `bool(pd.NA)` which returns a TypeError.

So before you use `astype(bool),` be sure that you don't have any NA if you don't want them to become `True`(use `dropna()`if you want to exclude the rows), or alternatively use `fillna(False)`if you want to keep them, but to be set to `False` instead. Or set it as category instead of casting to bool, and then you will notice that there's a third category.

It’s super basic: no libraries, nothing fancy. Because I never watched any tutorials, I got very comfortable with just the basics: `for` loops, `if` statements, and lists.

Here’s my problem: How do I actually learn more advanced concepts and better, more efficient ways to do things? Everyone says *“just build projects”*, but when I do that, I just stick to my old habits, because that’s all I know. Do you get what I mean?

Took a coding course in college that I passed by the skin of my teeth, and now I use Excel a ton for work and decided to try to learn Python to improve my processes.

Since reading into all the things Python can do, I was wondering if I could create an aggregator to collect events from the calendars of different local business websites and display them all together so that I don't have to check each calendar separately every time I want to do something fun.

I know RSS Feeds can do this in a way, but many websites aren't publishing RSS feeds anymore and even some workarounds like open RSS can't get anything from, for example, the calendar applet that my local library uses.

Could I use python for aggregating and displaying a bunch of different events from sources on the web?

I've been trying to install the **CybORG++** package on Google Colab for a research project, and I'm facing a very specific and persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` that I can't seem to solve. I believe it's due to a confusing directory structure and how `pip install -e .` handles it.

**My Goal:** To successfully install `CybORG++` in editable mode on Google Colab from a [`cybORG++.zip`](http://cybORG++.zip) file.

**My Directory Structure (from** `!tree` **command):**

* [`setup.py`](http://setup.py) **and** `Requirements.txt` **are here:** `/content/CybORG_plus_plus-main/Debugged_CybORG/CybORG`
* **The actual** `CybORG` **Python package module is here:** `/content/CybORG_plus_plus-main/Debugged_CybORG/CybORG/CybORG`
* **Other files like** `version.txt` **are in the inner** `CybORG` **folder.**

**The Problem:** After running `pip install -e .` from the [`setup.py`](http://setup.py) directory, the installation completes with many warnings (which I know are common). However, when I try to run my code, I get a `ModuleNotFoundError` for a submodule.

**What I've tried:**

1. **Standard installation from** [`setup.py`](http://setup.py) **directory:**
   * `pip install -e /content/CybORG_plus_plus-main/Debugged_CybORG/CybORG`
   * **Result:** Installation appears to succeed, but running the test code fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'CybORG.Simulator.Scenarios'`. This happens because `pip` sets the outer `/CybORG` as the package root, but `Simulator` is in the nested `/CybORG/CybORG` folder.
2. **Attempting to fix the paths in** `setup.py`**:**
   * I added `packages=find_packages(where='CybORG')` and `from setuptools import setup, find_packages` to [`setup.py`](http://setup.py) and ran the installation again.
   * **Result:** This immediately fails with a `metadata-generation-failed` error. I believe this is because `find_packages` can't find a `CybORG` directory within the current directory (`.../CybORG/`) as it's looking for `CybORG/CybORG`.
3. **Attempting to move files:**
   * I tried copying [`setup.py`](http://setup.py) and `Requirements.txt` to the inner `/CybORG/CybORG` folder.
   * **Result:** This also leads to a `metadata-generation-failed` error, likely because [`setup.py`](http://setup.py) then can't find `version.txt` in the expected `CybORG/version.txt` path.

It seems I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place with this nested directory structure.

**My questions are:**

* What is the correct way to handle this specific nested structure (`package_root/package_name/`) with `pip install -e`?
* Should I be using a different `setuptools` function or a different `pip` command to correctly identify the package root?
* Has anyone successfully installed `CybORG_plus_plus` on Colab and can share the exact steps?

It gives me the error you'll see but I also noticed some symbols in my data I want to remove but can't figure out how. I have no prior experience or training so I really appreciate any help!

Symbol I want to remove from data in list: `\xa0`

Example of erroneous data:

    ['title:\xa0data science team lead (de facto the head of)',
      'title:datascienceteamlead(defactotheheadof)',
      'tenure length:\xa03 years',
      'location:\xa0nyc/israel',
      'location:nyc/israel',
      'salary:\xa0190000',
      'salary:190000']]

Code I tried to remove `\xa0`:  lines 10-11 of cell 19. (first line was from tutorial added second in an attempt to get rid of the characters)  `tmp.append(re.sub('\t|\u2060','',i))`

`tmp.append(re.sub(r'\s','',i))`

Error when creating dictionary:

`pip3 install pyserial` produces the dreaded `error: externally-managed-environment` error.

Googling whether 'pyserial' is a brew/cask, looks like it isn't, and that most people use pip or pip3 to install it.

The externally-managed-environment message inclues:

    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
        it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
        virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with
        
        brew install pipx

So I did that, without truly understanding what a virtual environment is or does, or how/what/why my python3 installation would have access to it or in any way cooperate with it. Sure enough, after pipx was installed, I tried `pipx install pyserial` only to be informed that `'pyserial' already seems to be installed.` O...kay. So I try `pipx show pyserial` to verify this and see where it's installed, and I'm told 'show' is not a valid pipx command. So I once again try `pip3 show pyserial`, and, of course, I get `WARNING: Package(s) not found: pyserial`, as expected. So I try to run `python3` and enter `import serial`, just on the off chance that this 'virtual environment' provided by pipx is somehow working invisibly, but of course there's no change, and I get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'serial'`. :sigh:

Googling for solutions to this just sends me in the same circles, round and round.

* ""Try using pip or pip3, depending on your installation""
* ""Use a virtual environment""
* ""pyserial is not included with most distributions of python, so it must be installed with pip or pip3""
* Installing with pip3 leads to the ""externally-managed-environment"" error (managed by homebrew package installer? ... can/should I verify this is the external management being referred to here?)
* Virtual environment provided by homebrew's `pipx` thinks it has `pyserial`, but this is news to my python3 installation

Annoying thing is, I just had this exact same python project up and running within minutes on a different computer with a fresh macos installation and python3 installed from the website rather than through homebrew. I'm trying to avoid that method here as I don't want to ""contaminate"" my setup with another superfluous installation of python3 if possible.

However, to call something a proper videogame, you also need a visual component, maybe made up of a few characters and objects interacting with each other, perhaps using Pixel Art, which I personally love.

I searched online, and most of the tools that let you create even a single sprite require an account, ask for an email, are paid, or only work online. There is some open-source software that runs locally, but it can be quite complex to set up, and all I really want are a few simple tools to draw the character/object I have in mind.

Why not create an editor that only does that one thing? From past experience, I’ve loved working with Qt, especially using PySide widgets. So, here it is: I wrote it from scratch using PySide6. No installations, no configurations. You just download it to your computer and start using it right away.

There’s still a lot that could be improved, but it remains a simple and personal project, nothing demanding. I just hope it might be useful to others. It runs on Windows, MacOS and GNU/Linux.

I just built a new PC that I'm using when I WFH. I am trying to use VS Code to access a SQL server via Python. Everything else works great... except this:

When connected to my organization's VPN, I can connect to the SQL server and query via MSSQL in VSCode.

When I try to use SQL Alchemy and pyodbc, it kicks back an error. This error all comes back to authentication, which on my current device fails silently. My organization uses Microsoft Authenticator, and the server itself uses ActiveDirectoryInteractive to authenticate.

When I run the same code at work on my work computer, the interactive window pops up and allows me to login so I know it works fine.

On my home computer, the interactive window to login never appears.

This is incredibly frustrating. I have the most up to date drivers, Edge WebView2 is properly installed, my OS is up to date. I've tried it in terminal, in power shell, and in vscode itself. Again, I can connect to the server IN VS CODE just not through python and pyodbc.

I've also tried using a token (which didn't work). It all gives me the FA004 error with the failure to authenticate.

My question is: since my computing experience mostly revolves around algorithms (I’m a physicist), what would be a good stack for using Python to build applications both for the web and Android/IOS? Also, what limitations should I expect when integrating that stack? For example, what use cases might not be usable, like creating a recommendation website, for instance?

I want to avoid depending solely on Streamlit, but I’m also hesitant to dive into learning JavaScript and other languages without knowing if it’s worth it or necessary. I’m thinking of building projects and websites that use LLM for recommendations and so on, but I have no idea how to do that without Python, since there are so many ready-made frameworks.

My query is regarding values of max\_tier and key (line 100).


It will help to have an explanation of line 101 and 106.

  
Update:

  
key = max\_tier and key = max\_tier - 1 denotes the lowest and one above the lowest tree tier respectively?

If suppose a tree has root (0), 1, 2, 3 tiers. 
So max_tier = 3
max_tier -1= 2

        if key! = max_tier - 1:
            offset//= 2

This will be applicable for 1 tier onward?

Hello dear programmers,

I am reading, via a COM-API, data from from PTV Visum (which is a GIS-programe). Parameters are given via a functioning GUI, and the programme actually used to work a year ago.

However, after running the shown code, the programme breaks down (it still does print statements tho). sorry for the code being in German. No error messages, only the loading sign of the mouse appears. I tried deleting the code that creates the charts, as that is sometimes a dangerous undertaking, but nothing changes. I would be very thankful for your help, a lot depends on it for me unfortunately.:

    I am reading, via a COM-API, data from from PTV Visum (which is a GIS-programe). Parameters are given via a functioning GUI, and the programme actually used to work a year ago.However, after running the shown code, the programme breaks down (it still does print statements tho). sorry for the code being in German. No error messages, only the loading sign of the mouse appears. I tried deleting the code that creates the charts, as that is sometimes a dangerous undertaking, but nothing changes.

* Frontend Tech Stack: React, JavaScript, Tailwind, Chrome Extension API, Git, GitHub
* Backend Tech Stack: Express, Node, JavaScript, MongoDB, Stripe API, Google OAuth, Docker, Git, GitHub
* Proficient in at least one general-purpose programming language such as Python, or proficiency in analytical languages such as SQL or R.

I don't know where to begin. I'm only a 2nd year student but I need to start somewhere. I can't even find internships without coding experience. I'm afraid of investing too much time in learning a program but then ending up needing a different one. I don't know what half of this even is. Should I just find some free online course for Python and get busy? I feel like Python is a good place to start? It seems like every job/internship I look at wants different languages.

I'm trying to find brands within a store name and then returning the proper Wikidata ID (format: Q1234567) of it.

Here's the code I'm working on:

            ""ファミリーマート"": ""Q11247682"",

                    item[""brand_wikidata""] = self.WIKI_IDS[store_type][key]

Note: in this example the numbers 1, 2, in the dictionary is the store_type, so 1 is convenience store brands, 2 is gasoline stations. It's provided as an integer. Based on the provided store type, I want to find brands associated with it.

How can I use the keys in the dictionary to search the store string (store[""locationNameLocal""]) for the key text and then return the one that matched so I can assign its corresponding Wikidata ID to item[""brand_wikidata""]?

I know that ""in"" returns True if it's found but I want a way to get the string that actually matched the store name.

If I need to switch to a different data type that's fine as well, especially if it makes the code faster.

I've recently been trying to make the switch over to using Quarto to write out some Python and R code for my data science projects. However, I've noticed that quarto doesn't seem to be capable of rendering unicode characters (particularly greek letters) when I try to write them into my Python code blocks.

For instance, when I was using Jupyter Notebooks, the IDE would give me the option to display \\epsilon as ε. However, in my qmd file I'm not seeing any such option.

Does anyone here know if there's a way to enable unicode support in qmd files, or should I just stick to avoiding these as variable names?

Configuration white paper for special needs communication devices

We need a good configuration format for our python code libraries.  In the 90's I used a hyper-card like system where each card represented a menu or menu item.  I'm thinking about doing the same thing with individual files so that ""actions"" can be moved between menu's by more simply and shared etc.

The current system is running, but the configuration is really simple and doesn't support submenu's or text.

Everything needs to be in human readable format.  Everything should either be editable in a text editor by a non-engineer or it should be very easy to create a multi-platform editor to make it so the care-givers / teachers can configure the menus.

There are currently 3 things that I think a menu item can be

1. Action
   1. Play a sound file
   2. Display a picture
   3. Vibrate the device in specific way - see haptic feedback chart
   4. Pretty lights / pretty lights pattern
   5. Bring up menu / new menu
2. Fixed Graphic Menu
   1. Display a picture
3. Maybe with zoomed pictures of all the sub items2. Action fields for menu elements
4. Fixed Text Menu
   1. Display Text
   2. Action fields for menu elements
5. List Text Menu
   1. Bring up display Text with indications of what buttons actions will be
   2. Probably scroll

It seems tiers[key] still holds the node object as accessed through argument in set_tier_map function till the time tiers[key] = current_tier. It is now there will be string representation of tree.

I’ve recently learned Python and can now make basic projects. I’m excited to get better, but I’m not sure how to move from “knowing the basics” to actually mastering it.

I especially want to improve my logic building so I can solve problems more efficiently and write cleaner code.

For those who have already gone through this journey, what worked for you?

Should I focus more on projects or on solving coding challenges?

Which resources/books helped you level up?

How do you practice thinking like a programmer rather than just memorizing syntax?


Any tips, resources, or personal experiences would be super helpful.

As a result, I do not need any common serialization format such as JSON, csv etc. The biggest thing is that I want to have a fair amount of arbitrary code as fields for different items. Then, suppose I get some val, which is a function of the whole table, which can have whatever properties and methods for this purpose exactly.

    def get( table, val ):
        if callable( val ):
            return val( table )
        else:
            return val

So then each `val` could be a function or a value. This is perhaps not the best way to implement it, but hopefully it demonstrates having arbitrary functions as values. I'm confident in this part.

My question is what is the best way to store the data? If it's in `mymodule`, then I was thinking something like providing a common `get_table` method at the top level of the `mymodule` file, so then I could use `importlib`, like from

    spec.loader.exec_module(module)

This method seems a little excessive for loading a single `.py` file to run a single function `my_table = mymodule.get_table()`, relying on attached methods from `my_table`. I know that LUA loves to do this type of thing all the time, so I figure there must be some best practice or library for this type of use case. Any suggestions for simplicity, maybe even not loading a full on module, but to simply use a `.py` file for read only data storage?

I have a tiny Python script that runs as a Docker healthcheck every few seconds.
I want a **fully static binary** (glibc or musl) with:

* Minimal startup (<=0.3s like PyInstaller, no `staticx` unpack delay)
* Runs in *any* base image (old glibc, Alpine/musl)
* No FUSE/AppImage dependencies
* Willing to build Python from source
* Already tried PyInstaller, staticx, Nuitka, Alpine static build → all hit roadblocks

Looking for a way to **bundle libc** without killing startup time, or actually compile Python fully static so Nuitka/PyInstaller can produce a self-contained binary.

---

### Background

I’ve got a small Python CLI that’s called frequently as a Docker container healthcheck. That means:

* Every extra fraction of a second matters (runs a lot → CPU spikes are noticeable)
* Needs to work in *any* container base image (new, old, Alpine, glibc, musl, etc.)

I know Python isn’t ideal for static binaries — not rewriting it.

---

### Attempt 1 — PyInstaller

Dockerfile example:

```dockerfile
ARG BASE_IMAGE=scratch

FROM python:3.13-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --root-user-action=ignore --no-cache-dir . pyinstaller
RUN pyinstaller --onefile --name my_app --strip --optimize 2 --console src/my_app/cli.py

FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}
COPY --from=builder --chmod=755 /app/dist/my_app /usr/local/bin/my_app
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --timeout=2s --start-period=120s --retries=3 CMD [""/usr/local/bin/my_app""]
```

✅ Works great on new images  
❌ Fails on old base images (e.g., Ubuntu 20) due to newer glibc requirement.

---

### Attempt 2 — staticx

Wrapped the PyInstaller binary:

```dockerfile
RUN staticx --strip dist/my_app dist/my_app.static
```

✅ Works everywhere, bundles glibc  
❌ Startup time jumps from \~0.3s → \~0.8s + CPU spike every run (due to unpack step).

---

### Attempt 3 — Nuitka

`--standalone --onefile` produces a nice binary.  
❌ No static libc support built-in.  
❌ staticx + Nuitka binary → fails (both bundle files, metadata conflict).

---

### Attempt 4 — Alpine + musl

Tried to leverage musl’s static linking support.

* Stock `python:3.13-alpine` → no static `libpython` → PyInstaller/Nuitka still dynamic.
* Tried building Python from scratch via `pyenv`:

```bash
PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=""--disable-shared"" pyenv install 3.13
```

Builds, but **musl still dynamically linked**.

```bash
PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=""--disable-shared LDFLAGS=-static"" pyenv install 3.13
```

Fails with:

```
relocation R_X86_64_32 against hidden symbol `__TMC_END__' can not be used when making a shared object
...
```

I don’t understand why it’s even attempting to link something dynamically.

---

### Attempt 5 — Build on older glibc

Would fix old-OS issue, but:

* I want to build on a fully patched, up-to-date system for security reasons
* Would lock me to glibc (no Alpine/musl)

---

### Out of scope

* AppImage → needs libfuse, can’t require that.

---

### Where I’m stuck

Right now, the *only* working solution is staticx — but it wastes 95% of runtime unpacking instead of running.

I need either:

* A method to bundle libc without the runtime unpack
* A way to build Python completely static (glibc or musl) so Nuitka/PyInstaller can generate a fully static binary

---

**Questions:**

1. Should I double down on trying to get Python to build fully static with musl?
2. Are there better tools than staticx/Nuitka/PyInstaller for this?
3. Any proven tricks for bundling libc *fast*?

And yes, I’ve asked LLMs until my eyes bled — most of these attempts came from that. Still stuck. Any advice appreciated.

Looking for community wisdom,"I've been wrestling with log injection vulnerabilities in my Flask app (CodeQL keeps flagging them), and I'm surprised by how little standardized tooling exists for this. After researching Django's recent CVE-2025-48432 fix and exploring various solutions, I want to get the community's take on different approaches.  
For those asking about impact - log injection can be used for log poisoning, breaking log analysis tools, and in some cases can be chained with other vulnerabilities. It's also a compliance issue for many security frameworks.

# The Problem

When you do something like:

    app.logger.info('User %s logged in', user_email)

If `user_email` contains `\n` or `\r`, attackers can inject fake log entries:

    user@test.com
    FAKE LOG: Admin access granted

# Approaches I've Found

# 1. Manual Approach (unicode_escape)

# Sanitization method

    def sanitize_log(value):
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return value.encode('unicode_escape').decode('ascii')
        return value
    
    app.logger.info('User %s logged in', sanitize_log(user_email))

# Wrapper Objects

    class UserInput:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
        def __str__(self):
            return sanitize(self.value)
    
    U = UserInput
    app.logger.info('User %s from %s', U(user_email), request.remote_addr)

**Pros:** Full control, avoids sanitization of none-user data  
**Cons:** Manual sanitization (can miss user data), affects performance even when logging is disabled

# 2. Custom Formatter (Set and Forget)

    class SafeFormatter(logging.Formatter):
        def format(self, record):
            formatted = super().format(record)
            return re.sub(r'[\r\n]', '', formatted)
    
    handler.setFormatter(SafeFormatter('%(asctime)s - %(message)s'))

**Pros:** Automatic, no code changes  
**Cons:** Sanitizes everything (including intentional newlines), can't distinguish user vs safe data

# 3. Lazy Evaluation Wrapper

    class LazyLogger:
        def info(self, msg, *args, user_data=None, **kwargs):
            if self.logger.isEnabledFor(logging.INFO):
                sanitized = [sanitize(x) for x in user_data] if user_data else []
                self.logger.info(msg, *(list(args) + sanitized), **kwargs)

**Pros:** Performance-aware, distinguishes user vs safe data  
**Cons:** More complex API

# 4. Structured Logging (Loguru/Structlog)

    import structlog
    logger = structlog.get_logger()
    logger.info(""User login"", user=user_email, ip=request.remote_addr)
    # JSON output naturally prevents injection

**Pros:** Modern, naturally injection-resistant  
**Cons:** Bigger architectural change, different log format

# What I've Discovered

* **No popular logging library has built-in protection** (not Loguru, not Structlog for text formatters)
* **Django just fixed this in 2025** \- it's not just a Flask problem
* **Most security discussions focus on SQL injection, not log injection**
* **CodeQL/SonarQube catch this -** but solutions are scattered

# Questions for the Community

1. **What approach do you use** in production Python apps?
2. **Has anyone found a popular, well-maintained library** that handles this transparently?
3. **Am I overthinking this?** How serious is log injection in practice?
4. **Performance concerns:** Do you sanitize only when logging level is enabled?
5. **For those using structured logging:** Do you still worry about injection in text formatters for development?",5,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mllnom/how_do_you_handle_log_injection_vulnerabilities/,False,True,False

I'm sorry if this question is not scrictly Python related, but more an architecture question; but is the first time I'm approaching this kind of problem and I'm doubtfull about which of the two implementations I should use.

I'm developing a test suite in python. The test suite connect a DUT with a bunch of instruments. For a given insturment, more models are supported. The model accepts slightly different parameters name for their VISA commands, but performs the same exact action.

So I created an abstract class, like this:

    class Instrument(abc.ABC)
    ...
    u/abc.abstractmethod
    def set_parameter(self,parameter) -> None:
        pass
    
    class Model1Iinstrument)
    def set_parameter(self,parameter) -> None:
        #do something specific for model1
    
    class Model2(Instrument)
    def set_parameter(self,parameter) -> None:
        #do something specific for model2

Now, for some kind of parameters that are omogeneus and which methods are called often during the code, this implementation works well. For example some parameter have numerical value, they are called inside the code, multiple time and in multiple place, so this definitely makes sense.

But there are other parameters, that are basically initial settings, that are called one time in the code, let's say they are ""initialization"". They are a lot and significantilly vary from model1 to model2.

Now I have 2 architecture implementation possibile:

1. Create a structure in the ""instrument"" class where each attributes rappresent one of these initialization parameters. Then, the methods that will set these parameters won't accept any paramaeter but just act on self. This is the way suggested by Gemini (Google AI).

2)let it as is and create methods with parameters as the example above.

For code redeability I wanna also create a JSON, for eache model, that collect every initiailization parameter, so if I want to modify something I just need to modify the JSON, not the code.

At the beginning of the module the code will understand which model has been instantiated, call the relative JSON and load the parameters, then call the abstract method to set the paramaters.

While I think in generale the option 2 makes the code simplier, the additional JSON loading may benefint from a defined structure with attributes names for each parameter (or even a more complex strucure with class as attributes).

A little background on me. I’ve lived and breathed SQL for the last 8 years. I’ve done some minor modification of Python code written by others (such as updating the code to be compatible with a major Oracle upgrade), but beyond that my coding experience is limited to some C coding in high school, html pre html5, and some vb in college.

I started by going through automate the boring stuff and I got through to the chapter 9 practice questions mostly avoiding loops and just writing a bunch of unreadable code. I’ve been proceeding with the mentality of: just make the code work, go back and fix it later.

But I’m at a point where I do not want to proceed until I can make better sense of loops because I realize they are fundamental for writing Python. My primary reasons for learning Python are to: learn to pull my own data from apis, and to cleanse this data before importing into a new system. Right now I’m very painfully doing this all in excel with absurd regexextract formulas. After this, I want to learn JavaScript as well because one of the systems I admin uses js for customizations.

For others that struggled with loops, what helped you wrap your head around them? I think specifically it’s mostly how it loops through a range, list, dictionary, etc. that really throws me off.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, the sooner my thick skull can figure this out the sooner I can be more effective at work. And I don’t want to just Claude everything (which I’ve unfortunately started leaning on heavily throughout the book).",7,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mll3s5/struggling_with_loops/,False,True,False

Need help for this part of the code:

for key in sorted(tiers,reverse=False):  
current\_tier = nextTier\[:\]  
nextTier = \[' ' for i in range(2\*\*(key+1))\]  
for tree in tiers\[key\]:  
i = current\_tier.index(True)  
current\_tier\[i\] = str(tree.get\_value())  
if tree.get\_left\_child():  
nextTier\[2\*i\] = True  
if tree.get\_right\_child():  
nextTier\[2\*i+1\] = True 



  
It will help to know why \[2\*i\] and \[2\*i+1\] as part of this:

if tree.get\_left\_child():  
nextTier\[2\*i\] = True  
if tree.get\_right\_child():  
nextTier\[2\*i+1\] = True 

I understand perhaps next tier is reserved with True slots in case the tree has left/right child. But how and why 2\*i and 2\*i+1 fits into the indexing. A visual diagram could have made it easier to understand.

nextTier = True and current\_Tier  due to copying also becomes True only for root or 0 tier.

nextTier = \[' ' for i in range(2\*\*(key+1))\]

  
Above create lists with blank values as elements for  each tier.

But while replacing blank with actual node value,  why  checked if it has True value instead of ' ' or blank. 

Or is it that True here denotes if the list element exists? If so, why there was a need for:

nextTier =  \[True\]

The above could have been left as:

I'm making a simple Python program with the `turtle` module. It draws a shape based on user input, but I'm having trouble with the program's loop. I want to ask the user if they want to make another drawing after each one is finished.

I'm getting a `turtle.Terminator` error when I try to use `turtle.textinput()` to ask the user if they want to continue. It seems like the turtle window is closing permanently before the prompt can appear.

I'm looking for a clean way to handle this loop so the program can end gracefully without an error.

Here's my code:

[`main.py`](http://main.py)

    from user_input import get_user_input, ask_to_continue
    from drawing_logic import draw_shape
    
    continue_drawing = True

	import package #some external package

	async def process_async(data):
		def blocking_function():
			result = long_running(data) #some long running calculation the resut of which is what we ultimately care about
			return result
		result = await asyncio.to_thread(blocking_function)
		return result


	# an_obj and data get passed in from the package event loop
	async def some_func(an_obj, data):    
		result = await process_async(data)
		await an_obj.update (result) #this triggers some internal logic
		

	# set up an event handler
	package.some_event_handler(some_func)
	package.start_loop()


This code works, but the problem is that I want to throttle the events. That is at a high level, I want to put them into a queue and then process them at a fixed interval (i.e., every 5 second). Something like this:


	import package

	# feel free to modify this
	async def process_async(data):
		def blocking_function():
			result = long_running(data) #<- again this is what we ultimately care about executing
			return result
		result = await asyncio.to_thread(blocking_function)
		return result


	# an_obj and data get passed in from the package event loop
	async def some_func(an_obj, data):    
		
		# Instead, push the job into a queue that runs jobs at a fixed interval
		# (i.e., every 5 seconds) and returns the result of long_running()
		result = await job_queue.add_job(process_async, data)   
		
		await an_obj.update (result)
		

	# set up an event handler
	package.some_event_handler(some_func)

	package.start_loop()


So again the idea is to push a job into ""some"" structure that can then run the jobs and provide return values in a intervaled manner. But that's as far as I've been able to go. I'm not totally new to async, queues and threading, but I'm a bit stuck on this.

A couple of other openpyxl questions:

1. Is there a way to select a range of cells that have data? Something similar to having a cell selected, and then doing CTRL+SHIFT+ARROW_KEY. So if there's data in E2 and I want to get all the data that's below and to the right, in Excel I can select E2, then do CTRL+SHIFT+LEFT+DOWN which would select everything that has data, assuming no breaks. Is there an equivalent in openpyxl? Or do I have to select a wide range, then filter it out?

I'm a high school graduate, and I just started learning Python and completed a 2-hour crash course covering the basics like values, variables, and functions. Now, since I’m applying for a cybersecurity degree and know that the field involves automation and networks, I want to plan my next steps carefully. From where I am now, I need to deepen my Python skills, especially focusing on scripting for automation tasks, and start learning about networking concepts, protocols, and tools. Combining programming with a solid understanding of networks will build a strong foundation for cybersecurity. After that, I can move on to exploring topics like ethical hacking, penetration testing, and security tools to prepare myself thoroughly for the degree and career ahead.

Though I am aware that learning automation and networks are still far from where I am at, for reference. Promptly after finishing the 2-hour video tutorial, I went straight into ChatGPT to ask for exercises and it led me to Leetcode, in which I got stuck on the very first problem and went into the solutions to be very much confused by how in the hell this works.

I am now asking for as much help as I can get from experienced programmers! So if you know any good resources to continue learning python (as I feel that leetcode exercises are still way beyond my league) please do inform me!

I’m working on a sensor fusion project where the radar outputs target positions and speeds at 15 FPS, and the camera runs YOLO object detection at 30 FPS on a RPi5 + Hailo 8 AI Kit. I’ve managed to run both in parallel, with the radar running in a thread and YOLO running as a separate subprocess, and also saved the results separately as arrays. Below is the threading script, radar script, yolo script.

The threading script starts radar data acquisition in a thread and yolo in a subprocess. Radar script's update() function reads radar data from the serial port, decodes it, and outputs a timestamped list of scaled positions and velocities. Finally, the yolo script's callback function is invoked for each frame processed by the pipeline, receiving both the video frame and the AI metadata. This is also where I will implement the fusion logic using radar points and YOLO output.

So my goal is to achieve real time fusion by taking the most recent radar points from the update() function and pass them to the YOLO subprocess for fusion processing.

Is this possible? What would be a robust method to share this latest radar data with the YOLO subprocess?

When I try to print with new lines, the shell puts a space in front of lines 2-4. Why is this?

    eenie = ""Pinky Toe""
    meenie = ""4th toe""
    miney = ""3rd toe""
    Moe = ""pointer toe""
    print(eenie,""""""is eenie
    """""",meenie,""""""is meenie
    """""",miney,""""""is miney
    """""",Moe,""""""is Moe.

and it prints out:

>\>>> %Run 'python tester.py'

>Pinky Toe is eenie

> 4th toe is meenie

> 3rd toe is miney

> pointer toe is Moe.

I'm uncertain if the above behavior is ""just what Python does"", is what my IDE does (Thonny), or if there is some underlaying rule that I'm accidently violating that I could correct in my own code.

I'm currently converting the pcap to XML (PDML), then storing the data as JSON in the format: key: {value: \[frame\_numbers\]}. The problem is that a 50 MB pcap file becomes about 5 GB when converted to XML. I'm using iterative parsing to update the dictionary field-by-field, so memory use is somewhat controlled.

But the resulting JSON still ends up around 450 MB per file. If we assume \~20 users at the same time and half of them upload \~50 MB pcaps, the memory usage quickly grows to 4 GB+, which is a concern. How can I handle this more efficiently?

I have 4 such classes in my code that basically do the same thing for different areas of the body.

    # Use ""is"" instead. This checks for equality of object identity.
    ""etc"" is None  # => False
    None is None   # => True

What gives??? Is that a newer feature of 3.13?
