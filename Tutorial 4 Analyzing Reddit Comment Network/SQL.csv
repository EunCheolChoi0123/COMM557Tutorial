1,DrTrunks,">I appreciate any feedback you can provide!

So I've just been skimming through it. I got a couple of things for you. Since you're writing this for analysts, they're going to be querying data warehouses and large tables.

I see you're using ORDER BY 1 here and there. In production systems (and especially with MS SQL Server where you pay per CPU) you don't want to add an unnecessary sort operator as they cost CPU, I/O and time. On large datasets they require a worktable (temp table) to sort the data in and you won't get results until all the data is sorted (because the first result could come in last).

Correlated subqueries are horrible for performance (afaik always done RBAR in nested loops) and are better written as derived tables. Write your tables and joins in the FROM clause please. At the companies I've worked for these were banned from usage for these reasons.

>FOR XML PATH With STUFF

There's string_agg in SQL 2019 which is cleaner looking and performs better.


>temp tables

They're in 99% of the cases written to tempDB. In the other cases you didn't need a temp table. You're don't want to be waiting on writing. I/O is a big bottleneck in most DWH systems.

You can actually run the 4th CTE by just querying that without querying the 5th CTE, you don't need to run the *whole* thing its plain false.  
>temp tables @ 3 min

You can also just comment out your first query to run your second query (which is now the first after the CTE's) without having to bother tempDB with your #table. If you're just doing some ad hoc stuff this isn't the hardest thing to do. And if you like your CTE so much that you want to use it in another report, just create a view out of it.

>temp tables @ 4m

There's such a thing as global temp tables, just add another #

>temp tables 2 @ 2:50

It's not hogging memory, they're not in memory they're on disk in tempDB. Unless your query is just select * into #temp from table; SELECT * from #temp; it will be written to disk first!  
Millions of rows are never going to fit in memory on a busy SQL Server and will always be written down on disk in tempDB. Always try to use CTE's or views to try and keep tempDB empty and lazy and your data in memory in the bufferbool.

I see nothing on statistics or a query plan. Right now according to your content (the bottomline) it's more logical to create a temp table then update the statistics of your tables in order to to get better estimates and operators for your slower running queries.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

1. If a window is broken (W) , then the alarm will be triggered (A)
2. If Alarm is triggered (A) and it is nighttime (N), then **all the lights** are turned on (L)

In the question it says that both W and N  are true. And we know that if W is true, A is also True. Therefore (A and N) is true, and from premise two, we know that if (A AND N) is true, then  L (**all the lights in the house are turned on**)  is therefore true.

Statement 2 says that:

Windows Broken (W), but No Lights (\~L) ,THEREFORE it's not Nighttime (\~N).

This is true because, Broken windows (W) implies alarm (A). And IF it were nighttime (N) then the conjunction of (Alarm (A) and Nighttime (N)) would imply Lights (L).

&#x200B;

Therefore, if the windows are broken, the alarm is on. And if the alarm is on, it is either the case that:

1. it is daytime (and the lights can be on or off, it doesn't matter logically) OR
2. It is nighttime, and since it is nighttime, the alarm has triggered the lights to be on.

For those new to SQL, I think this is something you could use as you start to learn more about the SQL language.

For example, once you get to the point of knowing what a GROUP BY clause does but don't remember where in the SELECT statement it normally goes, this cheat sheet will be helpful for you. But if you don't know what GROUP BY is, this won't help much.

Likewise with CREATE TABLE statements - I often forget the exact syntax for parts of it, so this cheat sheet would help me.

It depends on how involved with application development your particular role is.  If the application developers are also writing their own SQL for schema changes and data access (or are just using an ORM), then it probably wouldn't be relevant to you.  If you're supposed to be collaborating with them on building a product, it's incredibly relevant.  I've seen database developers write the wrong thing plenty of times because they didn't understand how the application actually works.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

<p>It depends on how involved with application development your particular role is.  If the application developers are also writing their own SQL for schema changes and data access (or are just using an ORM), then it probably wouldn&#39;t be relevant to you.  If you&#39;re supposed to be collaborating with them on building a product, it&#39;s incredibly relevant.  I&#39;ve seen database developers write the wrong thing plenty of times because they didn&#39;t understand how the application actually works.</p>

I don't really agree with this sentiment.

Yes, you shouldn't be egotistical about knowledge transfer.

But on the same token, pointing out areas of improvement, optimization or best practices when a user is actively working on a problem is one of the easiest ways for someone to associate and grasp a concept. Answer their question, specify optional improvements if they're applicable, and be nice about it.

DS and DAs work with a *lot* of data, often in very big sets. Pointing out areas where they can optimize their code could ultimately save them a plethora of hours waiting for data sets to come back. They can choose to use the information if they wish, or discard it.

It is important though that it's done in a manner that's friendly and helpful.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

525,stiffupperleg,"I know it's a running joke but building pristine OLAP style environments is a thing. Most servers/environments aren't configured for them, and/or most businesses don't understand their value.

I'm finishing a project that has taken several months where we have designed an entire clean and pristine suite of tables that are designed to be joined together. All of the data they hold could have been calculated from other 'dirty' tables but the complexity of our queries has been so greatly reduced now that peer review is much easier, and it is much easier to fulfill any requests we have which will massively improve our overall efficiency.

In turn this also lets us get really complex and do things like predictive modeling efficiently because we handle all of the complexity, cleansing, and transformations on the stored procedure side. Basically we account for all known edge cases in order to just spit out a very elegant way to access our data.

The really slick part is that the size of our new DB is only 100GB, and only takes about 20 minutes to refresh daily, which solidly puts us at the bottom of the pack when compared with the rest of the company. 

Then we use some pretty clever functions and views that can create 'theoretical' sets of data that come in well over 1B rows of data, which solidly puts us at the very top of the pack when compared to the rest of the company and the datasets they work with, and our queries can ping those large sets to segment the data we're interested, or aggregate it very quickly. 

The final slick piece is that our aggregates or segments all come with an approximate PK to the raw source tables, so if we're missing some strange dimension that we chose to exclude from the database, we can just join over an grab it, or join over to validate the numbers we're seeing on an account level in order to increase the confidence we have in the accuracy of our reporting.

It has been a painful project that got a lot of push back from partner groups who didn't see the value, and for several months now there really hasn't been any demonstrable progress. I mean the project itself has progressed, but we haven't really *used* it yet to begin making improvements, so senior management (VP+) have been sort of gambling by letting me finish it. They hear from other groups it isn't necessary, but they have had enough trust and faith in me, and my direct counterpart on this project to give us the time needed to finish it.

It was only in the last week that we began to show it off to external groups (other data scientists, modelers, etc.) and the feedback has been explosive.","<div class=""md""><p>I know it&#39;s a running joke but building pristine OLAP style environments is a thing.

SQL can be great. You have to be methodical. People should be able to look at your tables and know what's in there and what relationships are between the tables by the names alone. If you are using abstract or entity models you should have a database that basically documents itself.

If you don't, you are constantly going to be frustrated with a database where every object looks like it's its own disaster. You now have to hope you have layers of abstraction to handle the migrations needed to unify the database.

#Performance

1. Read as few times as possible and watch for sorts.

Understand that still, even with SSD's in servers and cloud services these days. I/O is SQL servers biggest choke point.

DISTINCT performs a sort.

UNION performs a DISTINCT, UNION ALL does not.

2. Learn how to read an execution plan.

#CleanCode

Clean code concepts are in all languages.

I personally don't like _'s. I like to camelCase my columns and PascalCase my tables.

Whatever you choose, stick with it. It makes it much easier to read code if you recognize it as your work. This saves me a ton of time recalling code. 

I also can tell if there has been some fuckery going on and someone has been deploying code changes as they wont follow the same indentation and casing.

If you have code, source control it. 

Then there is normalization. Building databases and determining when you have like database objects and when you should use entity or an abstract object type is something you do per application and get through experience.

Less tables for similar objects is a good thing to live by.

I've seen finance sql guys write dbo.SummaryReport01012010 and dbo.SummaryReport01022010, then they write a report at the EOY that UNIONS (not union ALL) all these to reports together. Everyone of them is a heap. Every text field is VARCHAR(4000) or VARCHAR(MAX). No indexes. 

They blame the server when it doesn't have 120gb of tempdb swap space to execute their query.

DON'T WRITE DYNAMIC SQL. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY.

The programming language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following Edgar Frank Codd's paper, “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,” in 1970. IBM invented Relational Databases and SQL.

<p>The SQL programming language was developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The programming language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following Edgar Frank Codd&#39;s paper, “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,” in 1970. IBM invented Relational Databases and SQL.</p>

956,CeorgeGostanza17,"For context, I’m a data analyst at a large tech company. I’m going to give a slightly different answer than most people here. 

In my experience, recruiters tend to value business acumen and communication skills above technical ability when it comes to SQL (not a hard and fast rule). I think it’s way more important to market yourself as someone who’s a quick learner, able to convey statistical findings to a non-technical audience, who can also get themselves up to speed with whatever tech stack a company already is using rather than having deeply specific knowledge in one flavor of SQL. 

If you don’t have experience that’s super relevant for the type of work you want to do, I’d recommend making a website and using stats/code to do personal analytical projects for fun. Having a portfolio of projects is a fantastic way to show recruiters that you’re driven, can take initiative on your own, and have actually applied what you’ve learned in some capacity. 

For example, It’s not practical to use python in my day to day work flow (no one else on my team uses it, so I can’t show them how I arrived at my conclusions), so I used it in my own time to create a solver for the NYT Spelling Bee puzzle. I then did a write up on what I learned and posted it online.

It can never hurt to learn more SQL and Python, but make sure your excel is up to snuff first. Like it or not, excel is used just about everywhere. From there, look at the requirements on job postings and see where there are gaps in your technical skills. 

The last, and probably most underrated/important thing to do, is have as many informational interviews with data analysts as possible. Ask them about their day to day, how they ended up at the company, etc. 9 times out of 10, they’ll want to help you out and connect you with a recruiter after.

I had a similar experience when applying for a finance gig. I passed the first four stages with no major issues but in the final round of interviews I completely bombed it. I could clearly see that the interviewers knew I was crashing when they began to be super polite and kept reassuring me that “it is okay”. 

I Felt like absolutely s**t for the rest of the day but found myself laughing about  it the next day as I retold the horror story to my friends at how bad the interview went. Like legit it was 100% comically bad. I spilt water down my shirt the first time I attempted to drink the water they had just given me. I somehow forgot how to drink from a cup like a normal human being and I somehow placed half the cup over my mouth, the other half on my cheek… seeing the interviewers eyes and looking at one another in disbelief like wtf just happened, was a fantastic start indeed. 

 The rest of the interview didn’t fair better. It mostly involved me staring at the ceiling hoping for answers on numerous questions I had absolutely no idea how answer and praying them to suddenly appear in the sky, the awkward silence that seemed to last a lifetime was torturous. The wreck came to an end with the typical awkward “goodbye, we’ll never seen you again” handshake, And me walking out thinking wtf just happened and that’s my career done before it’s even began. That interview could not have gotten any worse.

What got me over that disaster was remembering all the questions I bombed and making sure to write them down immediately after the interview so I wouldn’t forget. I told myself it was a one off and that that type of interview bomb would not happen again, and finally, I practiced drinking out of a cup for a few hours (well only joking on the last bit ;) )

So trust me when I say that you’re not alone when it comes to having a car crash interview and you’ll honestly laugh at this experience sooner than you’ll think. 

Learn from the valuable questions you couldn’t answer, learn how to respond to questions you don’t know rather than sitting in silence like I did, and you’ll be all good. 

Remember It’s rare in an interview you’ll get 100% on technicals and that’s the point. Some questions are so niche because the interviews are looking to see how you’ll react to a challenging question in a stressful situation in real time, which is a skill in itself how to just react at such a question being asked.

50 Most Useful SQL Queries: learn-by-doing https://medium.com/@mondoa/50-most-useful-sql-queries-learn-by-doing-ee4fac0d70e5Hey, I highly recommended you visit this and subscribe here

A step by step guide

It is recommended that you learn the basics of databases before jumping into SQL. This will give you a better understanding of how data is stored, organized, and managed in a database. However, you can also learn SQL in parallel with learning about databases.

Compared to programming languages like Python and C++, SQL is considered to be relatively easier to learn as it is a declarative language that focuses on querying data rather than writing complex algorithms or functions. However, it does require a different mindset and approach to problem-solving.

To get started, there are many online resources available for learning SQL. You can start with free online courses or tutorials and then move on to more advanced topics. It is also recommended that you practice writing SQL queries and working with databases to gain hands-on experience.

1207,Wick_E_Scratch,"I would tend toward agreeing with you on this, based on my personal experiences as an interviewee, and as an interviewer.

Often times, if you've gotten that far in what seems to be a longer, multi step process, they've decided you know enough to do the job, and would likely be a good fit. 

The Tough Question round of interviews isn't usually about whether you know the correct answer or not. There are myriad reasons they do it. 

They could be asking to gauge if you are *too* knowledgeable - if someone is applying/interviewing for a position, but seems to know more than you would expect, there may be concerns the person would leave the job after a short time because it lacks challenge. Or, they could have concerns that the person would expect a higher pay rate than they would be able to offer for that position. Or, concerns about being too 'set in your ways' and be resistant to change or suggestions.

I would ask somewhat hard or tricky questions to get a feel for how the person problem solves, and how they communicate. Most of all, though, it gives a feel for how open they are to learning, because I ask if they want to know why their answer was correct/incorrect, and if they do, I explain it while keeping an eye out to see if they seem to be genuinely listening, or were just saying yes because they felt they had to. 

In general, I would rather recommend for hire a person who knows only a little but wants to learn vs someone who seems to think they know everything and they don't need to learn anything. 

Saved this for last, because it isnt a positive thing ... but another possibility is that they either had someone in mind for the job (internal hire, a friend, someone who interviewed right before you,  etc) but had to interview a certain number of people before they could make an official decision. So they ask super hard questions to convince yourself you aren't getting the job.

I did say it's still useful, but TOP is legacy. That's not good or bad. It's just true. If you were implementing a new RDBMS today, you would probably not implement TOP.

If you want to use TOP to preview data, that's perfect. It's fast and is easy to add and remove, and I use it all the time. I don't really prefer it outside of that. I'm almost always going to prefer OFFSET FETCH or one of the analytical or window ranking functions instead.

I do wish they'd relax or revise the syntax. The expression is *much* too verbose, but ISO/ANSI is braindead like that.

> what does offset fetch get me?

OFFSET FETCH gets you OFFSET. Actual windowing. When the data you're previewing is not really representative? Increase the OFFSET. Looking at rows 1-100 and want rows 101-200 instead? Easily done.

> My understanding is that I need to use an order by clause as well, which I don't need to do for 'top' queues (though of course sometimes I choose to).

TOP without an ORDER BY is non-deterministic. That's a pejorative when we're talking about databases. It's like saying it violates first normal form. It's like how MySQL used to default to allowing aggregation without a GROUP BY. It misleads developers and implies the system is doing something that it's not. The order isn't random. It's not guaranteed to follow any given clustered key. It's not guaranteed to be repeatable. It'll just be what ever the DB finds convenient at that particular moment. Performance may not even be indicative of anything. It's fine if you're just previewing data while writing a query, but otherwise it's really questionable. You're building your application to be unpredictable or inconsistent. I can imagine applications where that's fine (Twitter) but a significant portion of applications aren't going to want to operate like that.

IMX, about the only time TOP without an ORDER BY is really useful in a *production* setting is in an UPDATE or DELETE query where you're cycling through a loop to avoid locking the whole table. Those are pretty rare, but I have used them before.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

1490,stiffupperleg,"Things become slightly weirder years later.

I'll go back and look at something that looks weird as fuck. I'll curse my previous self for being so stupid to write something so dumb. 

I'll then spend an hour or two fucking around, only to suddenly remember what a genius my former self was, and realize exactly why that piece of code is there, and how awesome it is.

One 'trick' I can't encourage enough, especially if you work in analytics/datascience is to create an ""ID"" for your data that clearly shows you which part of a process a single row of data is being generated from.

A simple example from this last week has to do with building a table to house all FICO scores at the time of an application by customer. Seems simple except we've changed credit companies a few times, and the data for each is in separate places, and it isn't in the same structure. So the result is that I have to do multiple transformations, and it's entirely possible that a customer might have scores in each source which makes deduping, etc., a bit of a hassle.

The solution? Each transformation that I do has an integer which is stored in a column called ""SourceType."" If I happen to find a user who has two FICO's in the table... I can see immediately that one score comes from a specific piece of code, vs another, etc., and this allows me to trouble shoot very long/complex pieces of code easily.

A better example was a marketing cube I built a few years ago that has full error handling. It just can't fail, and it never has. It's in use to this day and everyone loves it. It's about 2500 lines of code in a single stored procedure that runs nightly and takes only about 10-20 minutes to run.

However once in a while you might find a strange row, or rows of data in the table which don't seem to make sense. You expect the data to be different for those rows because you can look certain records up in other tables... but where in the 2500 lines is the responsible piece of code for generating that record instead of taking the record you want? Well if SourceType = 8 you can do a CTRL+F, skip down to Section 8, read the notes as to why things are appearing in 8, but not 7, 6, 5, 4, etc., and quickly diagnose the problem.

Aha, it's appearing in 8 because they have a NULL value for some account detail in the source system... this is an error, and they should have a date there. If they had a date there, it would have been SourceType = 4, which is what you expected. Done.

In ~4 years my understanding is that a not a single line of code has changed in that process, although new sections (new SourceTypes) have been added to account for new business processes that weren't around when I first wrote it. 

Every. Single. Time. There has been an 'error' in that cube, it's been a result of someone forgetting to do something, or some system error upstream, and every single time it gets corrected by the groups responsible for those systems and will magically update to the correct values the next morning. 

100% of all marketing analytics & reporting is done on that cube, and you really don't need to ever join it to anything, but you may have to join it to itself several times. The beauty of this approach is that numbers always match and there is no confusion about one table saying one thing, and another table saying another, and having to crawl through code to figure out why.

Currently in the process of architecting a similar but less robust cube style table for Collections. Once built it will enable several people who aren't as strong in SQL to do advanced analyses that we will have a high degree of confidence in, and which are easily fact checked against the source.","<div class=""md""><p>Things become slightly weirder years later.</p>

1545,fullyarmedcamel,"Feel free to correct me if I am wrong here but I believe the way the system would handle the **DISTINCT** operator would be like this;

Pull data out of table in **FROM** statement

Processes data in the **JOIN**'s

Applies filters from **WHERE** clause

Pulls data out of **SELECT** statement

Applies filters of **DISTINCT**

As **DISTINCT** runs last it would have the least overall impact unless you have many duplicates, in my case it is around 2000.  You need to remember too that there is not just a single entry for students.

Some students will be taking multiple classes where this product I am rostering for is being used irregardless of the filters applied the rest of the query.

This document that I have has the purpose of creating a unique roster of students that can then be applied to classes within the application we are using multiple times over from a separate query that manages classes.

1546,JochenVdB,"Though nice for examples, it is very bad data modelling to store a person's age.
The problem is that it changes constantly, so in order to keep it correct, it should be updated constantly...
The correct solution is to store a date of birth (or maybe a year of birth). That doesn't change simply by the passing of time.
All queries would still work, but you'd have to express ""50 years old"" more like ""the date 50 years ago"" and compare that to the date of birth:
where age < 50
is equivalent to
where date_of_birth > add_months(sysdate, -50).
Also, do *not* do
where add_months(date_of_birth, 50) > sysdate 
Since that prevents you from using an index on date_of_birth. (Though eventually you'll get the same results)
For the duration of the query, add_months(sysdate, 50) is a constant, which can therefore be used to efficiently range-scan such index. 

Contrary: Storing age_at_first_subscription *is* acceptable data modelling: The age somebody had when something happened to them first, will never change.

1547,coffeewithalex,"Depending on the RDBMS and version, you might have issues with queries like the one on slide 5 (`WHERE something NOT IN (SELECT...)`). The reason being that the query parser has to catch this case and optimise it as a join, otherwise this becomes a very ugly nested loop instead of a join.

To force a join, I use a join instead. I don't trust optimisers too much.

    SELECT
      p.firstname

    LEFT JOIN cars c ON p.id = c.ownerId AND c.manufacturer = 'Audi'

This is also easier on the eyes once you get used to it. Less nesting, fewer parentheses, and as soon as you get what `LEFT JOIN` means, this makes complete sense. Basically the same as regular JOIN, but it guarantees that the `persons` row will be returned, even if it doesn't match any row in `cars` according to the condition in the `LEFT JOIN`. When rows are matched, you can access both data about the `persons` and data about the `cars`. When there's no match, all columns from the `cars` row will be `NULL`. They can be `NULL` naturally of course, but the JOIN key will never be `NULL` on a successful match, because `NULL` doesn't match anything in the first place.

1704,Zalack,"This strikes me as kind of a weird question. I don't have any personal experience in C#, but looking from the outside it's clearly a general purpose programming language to me. It was designed to compete with Java. I'm not sure about the idea that it was made to interact with databases; that's not at all what I think of when I first think of it. It was quite clearly Microsoft's answer to Java, which also was not designed primarily to interact with databases. In fact, most applications that use those languages would use SQL to do so (or some sort of ORM that generates SQL for you based on a Query builder).

C# can be used for [WebServers](https://gist.github.com/define-private-public/d05bc52dd0bed1c4699d49e2737e80e7), [Game Engines](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/games/engines), anything you want, really. It is designed to write any type of Software you like for any hardware that the runtime supports, and that to me is what we are meant to understand by the term ""general purpose programming language"".

I'm not arguing that SQL isn't technically a programming language in that it is, *technically*, turing complete. People have written a [web server] (https://cr0wn.uk/2019/plaid-triggered/) in it. But note that the creators of that stunt repeatedly use adjectives like ""monstrosity"" and ""atrocity against mankind"" to describe their invention, and clearly are aware the language, while technically capable of running a server, is way outside it's design considerations doing so.

PowerPoint is also [Turing complete](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjxe8ShM-8) and therefore *could* be used to write any arbitrary software one desired, and yet to call that a general purpose programming language world be to strip any useful meaning from the phrase.

SQL is a query language (as its name implies): its primary design consideration is how to efficiently describe ways to extract data from a data store. Anything beyond that is either accidental or in service of that goal. Nowhere in my reply did I imply it is *less than* a general purpose programming language, but it's purpose is clearly *narrower* in scope than general purpose programming languages. And that's great! I love SQL! I use it every day at work. It has wonderful syntax for that specific problem.

But labels are useful, and attempting to ""elevate"" tools we like into categories they don't really fit into just dilutes the usefulness of having those categories to begin with.

It's like the Go enthusiasts who whine that Go should be considered a low-level language since you can *technically* turn off garbage collection and handle memory manually. While true, it's clearly not how Go was really designed to be used, and is quite clearly not as low-level as C, C++, and Rust. What's happening there is Go programmers perceive some sort of elevated status in knowing a ""low level language"" and are letting *that misplaced desire for status* drive an argument about technical classifications. We might as well throw out the classification of languages at all if we aren't going to do anything useful with it in the way of describing what specific tools are designed for. Go is another language I absolutely love, so I do not say this out of any animosity towards it. It's my go-to language of choice for most things.

I just think that it's useful to have categories we can use to describe the overall capabilities and design goals of a tool, and we sometimes let our egos get in the way of common sense because we want to be able to say we know x kind of language when, by the commonly accepted spirit of that term, we don't.","<div class=""md""><p>This strikes me as kind of a weird question.

 select * from table

Copy paste the output into an excel doc, then name the columns the same as the challenge,  upload the table into a server on your pc, (like SQL server)and build your query on your server before you run it in hackerrank.

Up to that point I had only programmed stateless programs or tools. Automated myself out of jobs. When I first used SQL in the late 90s and early 2000s it made little sense. I was scrapping healthcare data off and old terminal using a scripting language and then running a command that would load it into tables on a SQL server. 

Years later, I am forced to spend a lot of time querying Unix databases and it's making more sense. 2 years pass and I pick up a job to be an information systems administrator and had to see what was going on SQL side of things.

When I started building automated jobs and challenged myself to learn how to interact with SQL from an application, my eyes were opened.

I will be honest that for app development, SQL is annoying. Relational Databases are fast for query and returning complex related data but for app development they are cumbersome in comparison to Jason document databases.

If you attempt to make an application that works with SQL server it will give you an use case and some great perspective.

I don't mean that to be rude, because it sounds like you're trying your best. I think you need to figure out how to stop overthinking things so much and go back to the basics.

One thing I try and tell newer developing SQL developers / query writers is... keep it simple. SQL is, at its core, a very simple ""language"". You're writing a very simple series of commands to tell the database engine how to relate two or more sets of information together.

In the example of your CASE statement, I'd be interested to know what the context of the problem is you were having and why it took 8 hours to realize that a CASE statement is what you needed. Quite frankly - a CASE statement is what I would consider one of the more basic functions of SQL, right there with SELECT, FROM, and WHERE.

One thing I've noticed is that in the SQL-based learning subs and even all over StackOverflow, people are so quick to jump on recommending CTE's and all these other complicated (relative to standard SQL) solutions to simple problems... I think there is a general obsession in the programming world with using over-complicated elegant solutions to solve problems to flex your understanding of something and how smart you are, partly. The other part of it is as you gain understanding, the more elegant solutions become more common-place since you recognize the power of them.

Make something work, first and foremost. Speed is important, but accuracy is paramount. You can always go back and revise your methods to produce faster results, or find new ways to optimize your queries, but really the accuracy of the data is the most important part.

It does sound like you could benefit from a new start in a less hostile environment, but I do think you should take some time to reflect on how you approach problems. Start simple, get complicated if you need to.

Another thing you could do, if moving on isn't quite what you're ready for, is make sure whenever you ask a question you also come prepared with what you have already tried and WHY you tried all of those things. That would really help someone pinpoint what you're missing in the process and why you got to all the wrong answers. Have you asked that question? ""What can I do to be better? I really want to improve and be more self sufficient, but I'm struggling on what else I can do besides just work through things"".

I think you have all of the knowledge to continue and succeed in the field - you just need to figure out how to work out whatever mental block you're running into, along with whether the environment you are in is conducive to your professional development and your personal mental health.

I would say that your coworkers are out of line in their comments, regardless of your current ability. It would be one thing to just not do the work. But to struggle and be engaged and get treated this way with no offer of help or solutions from colleagues or your manager is unacceptable. Performance plans have a bad ring to them but a good manager can use them for growth and development if done proactively and not as a result of workplace issues.

I'm going on 4 years into my role as a developer and the best thing I can tell you is to keep asking questions and don't be discouraged. Stackoverflow is good, but this subreddit is great. Take advantage of any employer-paid educational services if you can. O'Reilly has one through my work where I can find most published SQL books online for free.

Documentation. Document problems you have with a query. What your solution was, and how it could be applied in the future. Perfect example for CTEs. I had a query the other day that literally returned all data needed, but due to performance, the last join just killed any usability. By modifying join criteria and using a CTE I was able to go from an unreasonable query @ 30 min to a 1 minute result set. My onenote has a page on that now with a code snippet for future reference, as many of our data sets use common tables.

I also like to piece out my SQL in increments and get small pieces working first. I run a query at a minimum 5-10 times between big changes before doing any more complex pieces like joins, grouping, etc.

Get a feel for the data. Select * can be your friend. Assuming you are exploring or have business requirements, figure out table structures before hand. Comment findings in your code for easy access during development. I find the majority of my time ""developing"" is doing research either online or in my environment, with less time spent actually writing the code.

At the end of the day SQL is a very ""english"" programming language. If you have the critical thinking skills, determine what you need, from where, and how, before writing anything in your main query, using some above skills as well as logic. If you can explain in English what you need, there's a good chance you can think it through and translate it to a select statement.

I can definitely understand your situation. I am a message away if I can explain anything else to help.

1) Dont talk if the question is not for you or if there is someone who knows more than you do. 
2) Developing logic is not something smart people can naturally do, they still had to learn how to develop that logic. 
Eg if you want to bring a box thats away from you towards you, you will use your hand to pull it towards you (thats logic, knowing what to use to get it done).You know this because you saw it somewhere when you were a kid and thus you know.
3) Develop logic by doing some algorithms in leetcode. Start with the dumbest and the most basic ones. 
Do this in javascript or python (the easiest languages to learn). 
4) when working with a query, start by breaking down the query to the lowest level. Use subqueries. Use ""with"" clause to breakup your queries. 
Do a top down approach to queries. Start by thinking, if i want to ""select"" * from ""this"" what should ""this"" be. Now break the ""this"" into a subquery and ask the same question again, to get ""this"" what do i need to to select from another ""this"".

Now break the &quot;this&quot; into a subquery and ask the same question again, to get &quot;this&quot; what do i need to to select from another &quot;this&quot;. 
Last but not the least. People think its difficult to learn logic but its damn easy, you think its difficult because you just dont know it. YET.
BTW, I feel sorry for your situation and i will help you with your queries. Just send me a message in reddit</p>

""Master Miller: Snake, you've got to think. Your mind is your most dangerous weapon. If things are getting too complicated, try to simplify your thoughts.""

There are so many times, to this day after 6+ years of experience in sql and some in other languages, where I help myself so much by recognising where things have gotten tied up in knots. Where the code has become an overcomplicated mess of snippets and I've lost sight of the real objective. 
Always be willing to stop and think ""what am I actually trying to do, what's the outcome I need?""

Just a month or two ago I discovered string_agg through such searching and wondered how I didn't know it before. Do some research into dynamic code and looping and have a play around.

Perhaps just as importantly, don't let people make you feel like a worthless piece of shit. I've been there.

1870,ndum,"Hey, 

Sorry to hear about all of your troubles my friend. Sounds like what you need is an entry level Data Analyst job in the least a better team. 

In my old job we hired someone similar to you, with a lot of business analysis skill but minimal data analysis, but the mindset of the entire team was that it would take at least 9 months for him to ramp up on data portion. We hired him because he had skills that complemented our team, good document and communication skills. 

If your team only focuses on your weaknesses and not your strengths, you should start looking for a new job right now. a bad team or bad company can make you feel like you are worth less than you really are. 

On a different note, if you are having trouble remembering when to use a process with SQL, what you should do is save all of your past solutions and each time you have a new problem you should compare it to a previous problem and see if the same solution works. You should templatize all your work.. this helps automate repeated issues as well. This will help you to know when to use things like CASE or window functions faster, because you can look at an old problem that used a solution and change the data table and fields to work for a new problem.

Hope this helps, if you need more specific help feel free to reach out. 

And hang in there buddy, life can be hard but it’s a wonderful ride if you have the right people besides you.","<div class=""md""><p>Hey, </p>

>In the example of your CASE statement, I'd be interested to know what thecontext of the problem is you were having and why it took 8 hours torealize that a CASE statement is what you needed

I had a table with three columns

|ID|Count\_A|Count\_B|
|:-|:-|:-|

|435|1|1|

I kept importing data into Tableau and adjusting it there, but with so much data is kept bricking my system. Then Tableau calculations weren't working correctly either. It seems like simple queries like this I miss, but I can write some sub-queries, joins, and more advanced calculations.

1899,esseinvictus,"So with regards to your problem, I would question why you would think that the first order of business would be to import data from the source system to Tableau. Is it because you are uncomfortable with SQL? To help with this I would suggest going through a quick introduction on things like [Mode](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/) or DataQuest/DataCamp/Udemy/Coursera etc. then going to leetcode and hackerrank and practice some of the 'Easy' ranked questions there (try to come up with the solution first before looking at the answers) then 'Medium' and 'Hard' 

Just to give my perspective on your question, say I didnt know anything about SQL besides simple SELECT and FROM queries, if I was given a task like yours and I had no idea what the command in SQL to achieve this, what would I do?

1. Note that it seems like a logical problem. If you are familiar with logic gates and conditionals, this is exactly what it is. In all programming languages, there is a way to implement your logic, they are usually called if-else statements  
2. The general pseudocode goes: if Count_A == 1 AND Count_B == 1 THEN Corrected_Count_A = 0. But how do I do this in SQL? Googling if-else statement SQL yields the SQL CASE clause in one of the top results: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp  
3. From then on I would take a look at the syntax and try to understand how to use it to apply to my problem.  

Of course my train of thought was contingent upon me recognising that this is a simple if-else problem. There really isn't a shortcut to knowing this except suggesting that you take a SQL course.

/u/gakule put it best, instead of going to your Senior Data Analyst with an easy question like 'How do I pivot this table in SQL' which is an easily googleable question you could perhaps be more detailed and explain that you have tried pivoting this table and the results are not what you expected including an example of what you want the result to look like.","<div class=""md""><p>So with regards to your problem, I would question why you would think that the first order of business would be to import data from the source system to Tableau.

It seems like simple queries like this I miss, but I can write some sub-queries, joins, and more advanced calculations.

&nbsp;

What might help:

- Check the results of your code step by step. That means, if you have a CASE statement like in this case, put the parts of your statement in your select as a column. Doing so, you will be able to see what your code does as you will see the results on your screen. You can then adjust the code of the columns to get it as you want it, and if you are pleased with the results you can then put it in your select.

&nbsp;

I don't know which DBMS and SQL implementation you're using, my examples below are T-SQL (MS SQL). Also assuming you're checking it per row and not a combination of rows (a specific group of rows). The 'yes' and 'no' below are example, you can also use a boolean value (0 / 1), but your values are already 0 and 1, so I didn't want to confuse you, so I used 'yes' and 'no'.  


&nbsp;

- Do it step by step. If I understand you correctly, you want to check the value of Count_A, and the value of Count_B. If the value of `Count_A = 1` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  AND &nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;&nbsp; the value of `Count_B = 1`, you want to adjust the value of one of the columns to `0`.
&nbsp;  
  - 1) Add a new column in your select, that checks for the value of Count_A with a CASE. You want it to be `1`. For example: CASE WHEN Count_A = 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END.  
  - 2) Add a new column in your select, that checks for the value of Count_B with a CASE. You want it to be `1`. For example: CASE WHEN Count_B = 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END.
  - 3) Add a new column in your select, that checks for the value of Count_A *AND* Count_B with a CASE. You want both to be `1`. For example: CASE WHEN Count_A = 1 AND Count_B = 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END.
   - 4) Check the results of the previous steps. Change the code and test for different values, see if you understand your data. Test some other cases (for example: both are value `0`) and so on. 
   - 5) The end result of step 3 is either 'yes' or 'no'. If it is 'yes', both Count_A and Count_B are 1, meaning the value that you are interested in. In that case, you want to adjust the value of Count_A (or Count_B) to 0.   
     -  You can either adjust/extend the current logic for Count_A, or... wrap your current SELECT in a new SELECT -> nested select or subquery.  To keep it simple, in step 5 I will do the first one, so extend the current logic.
  - 6) Current logic for Count_A:  
        `SELECT TableX.Count_A AS Count_A FROM TableX`  
        ==>  
        `SELECT CASE WHEN TableX.Count_A = 1 AND TableX.Count_B = 1 THEN 0 ELSE TableX.Count_A END AS Count_A FROM TableX` 

&nbsp;

Basically:

- Write down what you need. Break it down to small bits. 
- Smaller is easier to understand and to explain, and easier to code.
- Code the small bits, debug your code while writing the small bits. See exactly what your code is doing.
- When your pleased with the result, combine the small bits to larger bits.
- Once your confident in your coding, you can optimize the code later.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

2049,penguin_apocalypse,">	Try deleting a production fact table in the middle of the day.

that’s how i ended up getting involved with sql many moons back. kid that was trying to admin the db deleted 14 years of transactional history between 23 stores in the middle of the day in prod. we were able to restore a backup from end of day before, but damn was corporate office very quiet that day. he was terminated once we could confirm the restore worked. my boss knew i was interested in that stuff (was in the accounting dept at that time), and away i went into the rabbit hole finally finding what i was good at and enjoyed doing. one of the senior developers of the software we used mentored me for a few months until i knew the most common fixes and reporting needed for the company. 

guess i should thank the kid for helping me find a career i actually enjoyed. did send a thank you gift to the developer for a tremendous amount of help and especially not being judgy as a girl.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

proceed to our company NOT contracting with his company and him still being the lead developer and his manager going from clueless to CYA mode. that team was REALLY shifty about why the API wasn't working. one day, an automated transaction would appeared to have worked - and then the next, a transaction with similar incoming data quality wouldnt work - almost like the entire process behind the scenes was manual.

long story short, he never built the API, and left the company - and I left the company too because I wasn't being paid enough to do what I was doing and was 100% positive my work was not going to be rewarded.

2120,eXceLviS,"As an uber Excel nerd and longtime data analyst and trainer, here's a few things to learn in no particular order:

* Power Query for querying, you can leverage your SQL knowledge
* Pivot Tables, and for multi-sheet relational data learn Power Pivot 
* Functions you should know, skipping the basics and all the typical stat functions that you'll already know
   * Vlookup, vertical lookup, know when to use True vs False in the final argument. Always use False until you know better. (Hlookup, is just vlookup with the lookup data moving horizontally)
   * **Xlookup** \- yes Vlookup is the old skool standard for lookups, but it's not needed if you know XLOOKUP. Also if you use XLOOKUP and talk about it, everyone will look at you like you are an Excel savant and want to know more. 
   * Understand Index and Match and then how people use Index + Match to do lookups
   * Sumifs, countifs, averageifs, minifs, maxifs (these are massively important)
   * Subtotal function, and why it's great to know when used with filtered data sets.
   * Text functions - Text, Substitute, Left, Right, Mid, Trim, Value, DateValue, DateDif
   * Round, MRound, RoundUp, RoundDown, Floor, Cieling
   * It's imperative that you understand the concepts of cell address references in formulas - know what these mean - ""relative references"" vs ""absolute references"" vs ""mixed reference"" - A1:A5  vs  $A$1:$A$5  vs   $A1:$A5 
* Charting of course, but that's a whole world of learning. Take a swing at Pivot Charts as well.
* Sorting / Filtering, Conditional Formats, + Advanced Filters are cool, but most don't know how to use them, but they can save you time if you have some really complex filtering to do.
* Excel Tables, not just a range of data that looks like a table but create actual Excel Tables (aka List Objects). Excel Table columns work more like database fields than simple ranges, and the field names are used when building formulas. Excel Tables are very important to know.
* Slicers for Excel tables - graphical filters, and can be used for Pivot Tables as well
* Learn about Macros, but VBA is a programming language and can take a long while to learn
* Copy Paste Values is your friend.

2492,da_chicken,"You could, but there's a few reasons it's not a good idea.

Any time you put a field in a function, you stand a very good chance of having the RDBMS ignore any indexes on that field. The common term used for this is [sargable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable).

Even if that weren't the case, the coalesce function would basically force the RDBMS to do at least the exact same amount of comparisons as just writing out the whole logic. `COALESCE(usertype,'') = ''` would have to test if `usertype` is null (because that's what COALESCE() does) and then you're still comparing the result to `''`. You're not saving the system any work.

Finally, there are some instances where this pattern doesn't work well. I can't think of an example off-hand but I seem to recall the final straw of this pattern for me was either when I needed to treat `''` and null differently, or else when I was doing outer joins with nullable fields nulls meant different things. Like where empty string on the left should match to empty string on the right, and null on the left should match null on the right, but null and empty string are different. I just eventually stopped thinking about using coalesce in a filter.","<div class=""md""><p>You could, but there&#39;s a few reasons it&#39;s not a good idea.</p>

2726,UnkleWillard,"I feel your pain...but there's better times ahead!

&#x200B;

I spent probably 6-8 months learning and self teaching. At first that was basically just watching youtube videos - What is SQL, how to databases work, more general stuff. Then after I understood the really high level basic stuff, I started moving towards watching tutorials, using websites where you can practice with datasets, and doing more hands on stuff. I also leveraged connections I had with people that knew SQL really well and picked their brain as much as possible.

&#x200B;

Once I had an interview (the company I'm currently at), I let them know that I was completely self taught and technically didn't have any professional experience. I wouldn't try and upsell yourself too much, because it'll be pretty obvious if you try and make yourself sound more experienced than you are. Be honest with your skill level, but lean more towards your passion/drive. I'm a really curious person and like learning new things, and they told me after I got the job that's more of what made them like me (personality and drive over skill level). You can teach pretty much anyone how to code, but you can't teach someone to care about something or get them interested in something they aren't interested in.

I'd be happy to go in more detail if you want, anything to help people get into a job in data that will make them happy to go to work! I used to DREAD the alarm going off and having to go into my old job, but since I've been in this position, I've enjoyed going to work every day and learning new things.

<p>I spent probably 6-8 months learning and self teaching. At first that was basically just watching youtube videos - What is SQL, how to databases work, more general stuff. Then after I understood the really high level basic stuff, I started moving towards watching tutorials, using websites where you can practice with datasets, and doing more hands on stuff. I also leveraged connections I had with people that knew SQL really well and picked their brain as much as possible.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Once I had an interview (the company I&#39;m currently at), I let them know that I was completely self taught and technically didn&#39;t have any professional experience. I wouldn&#39;t try and upsell yourself too much, because it&#39;ll be pretty obvious if you try and make yourself sound more experienced than you are.

2737,EarthGoddessDude,"Hey OP, this is really cool, nice work! 

I’m new to Python, but this kind of functionality relates (no pun intended) quite well to what I do at work. Although I’m new to Python, I noticed a few things that may need a bit of improvement (though you may have had specific reasons for why you wrote it the way you did). Here are some comments/suggestions:

1. The nesting in the layout section starting on line 16 is a bit weird. You have those square brackets lined up nicely, but when you start reading, you realize some of those are nested inside others...I would indent them according to their nesting level. 

2. On line 29 you use unrolling, but then on line 31 you specify each element of the list/tuple...why not unroll there too?

3. I would get rid of that empty line on line 36 in the if statement. 

4. That big if-for-if statement starting line 51, screams for a switch statement (although Python doesn’t have those). Those inner ifs should ideally be dicts. 

5. Also, why not have the loop be the top level? Your loop declarations are exactly the same. I would put the if statement checking for the db choice inside that single loop, and then use a dict for the data types. 

6. For looping through the columns, I believe it’s more Pythonic to use an iterator, meaning something like `for col in cols`, but then your indexing gets a bit wonky. This one I don’t feel that strongly about. 

7. Finally, I would wrap everything in functions and turn this into a package. That way more technical users can just write `import SQLake` (cool name and logo btw!) in their own scripts and not have to use the GUI. Then add a `if __name__ = “__main__”:` clause at the bottom in order to be able to run as a stand-alone script. 

I hope you agree with these suggestions. Let me know what you think either way. Overall, really cool stuff!

Edit: btw, I’d be happy to do a PR if you’re interested.

Edit2: as I’m re-reading my comment (as I’m wont to do), which I wrote shortly after awaking this morning, I realized my suggestion for point 5 doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.

2755,coffeewithalex,"> why not just code everything with Flask?

Because I need to make the server reliable, despite whatever data is being uploaded. Imagine the server being a minimal machine in the cloud. All it needs is fast internet and one CPU core. To make this work, you need:

* Non-blocking IO (not implemented in this project)
* Streaming data (almost nothing saved to RAM)
* Very light processing

So basically, if this server is getting a 200MB Excel file, the server is SCREWED. But I still want to make such an upload possible.

There's also the possibility of getting a [Zip Bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb).

So the principle should be: if the user's machine can handle 200MB Excel files, it will be able to to also process it in JS. Moreover, today's laptops are FAR more powerful than the server used there.

> Is it possible to do everything without JS?

Not on the client side. But yeah, sure, Python has Excel reader/writer libraries. But if anyone could take this code (that I've taken from somewhere else, and improved on performance dramatically so that it runs on O(n) and not O(n^(2)) complexity, and manages sheets correctly), clean it up, and upload to npm, then you can just import it and use it. For any Flask stuff you still need a Web Front-end, unless you're doing a front-end desktop app in Python and using a REST API to pass data.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

-----

The questions should decide whether they are for ""SQL"", for ""SQL Server"" or for Oracle. Some answers are specific to SQL Server and some for Oracle without revealing which ones. Some state ""in SQL"" but then shows concepts or functions specific to one database (and incompatible with standard SQL or other DBMS)

e.g. SQL (the query language) does not define indexes at all. So there is no such thing as a ""clustered"" or ""non-clustered"" index ""in SQL"". 

Also not every database calls it that. What SQL Server calls a ""clustered index"" is called an ""index organized table"" in Oracle. 

Therefor, the claim that a primary key is a clustered index is also not correct. E.g. Postgres doesn't have clustered indexes at all. And in Oracle the default is not to create a clustered index (=index organized table) when defining a primary key. 

> How to read LAST 5 records from a table using a SQL query?

The answer is way to complicated but doesn't even mention the most important part: there is no such thing as the ""last"" (or ""first"") row in a relational database. Rows in a table have no inherent sort order, so ""last"" and ""first"" **only** makes sense if an `ORDER BY` is used. When doing that, the ""last 5"" rows can much easier be retrieved using:

     select *
     from departments
     order by some_sort_column desc
     fetch first 5 rows only

> How to find the employee with third MAX Salary using a SQL query
without using Analytic Functions

Why would you do that _without_ window functions? Using window functions is typically way more efficient than the convoluted (and Oracle specific) kludge with the ROWNUM column.

But if you really want to avoid window functions then use at least the `fetch first` operator: 

    select *
    from employee
    order by salary desc
    offset 3
    fetch first 1 row only;


> SQL has built-in function called GetDate()

No, it does not. The built-in function ""in SQL"" is `current_date`. `GetDate()` is again specific to SQL Server.

> Write SQL Query to find duplicate rows in a database? and then write
SQL query to delete them?

    # Prints hello world text

That's not really useful. It's the kind of comments you see when you code against automatic coverage checking tools. About the only useful comments here are regarding date/time. 

Now onto code review.

HAVING should be limited to filtering aggregate results.

Reasoning: WHERE is processed inline via the optimizer during the query - in this case, it would *only* look at records with a staff_id of 2 when pulling data out of the tables.

The incomplete type annotations for parameter. 
The doc string says it’s a list of tuples that expected but the type annotation doesn’t specify.

Why did he bother typing the parameter but not the return value? Typing doesn’t have to be a 100% thing and optional so why optionally do it poorly. If he added typing to the return of the function I think he might have realized how poorly the function was named.

The doc string doesn’t really follow any common format or convention. One reason I like adding type annotations is that using Sphinx plugins it makes my documentation easier to maintain. I feel like this doc string is quickly at risk of not being maintained and causing later confusion. 
Why the extra carriage returns in the doc string?


The doc string is worse than no doc string because the very first line of it is wrong that’s not what this function is doing.

The function is named really poorly. The function doesn’t create a multi valued insert statement but rather returns a string of the values to be inserted.  The function could be made to take an iterable or sequence of tuples instead to make it more versatile but that’s not a huge deal.

Then there’s the implications of potential vulnerabilities

Finally and worst of all there was likely 0 reason to ever write this code. It is already done better and accessible in other packages. 

It’s 2am so I’m not certain but any db cursor in python that follows the dbapi should have an execute many command to use  for this  but pretty confident and I know sql alchemy provides this capability and if they’re connecting to a database in python they’re going to use something implementing the DB-API to do it.

3331,mwdb,"There are essentially two ways to handle parameters to your queries, i.e. values that you ""plug in"" that can differ with each execution: concatenation and proper parameterizing. Concatenating means doing something like this (example in Java):  

    
    String query = ""SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = "" + myIdVariable;
      
  
This is almost always the wrong way to do it.  
  
Parameterizing is basically using a placeholder in the query string, and your SQL API ""binds"" the individual values for the parameter using efficient and secure methods under the hood. It looks something like this: 
  

    String query = ""SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = ?"";  
    ...  
    statement.setInt(1, myIdVariable);  
    
Some databases can consume potentially tons of more resources if you do NOT parameterize. For example Oracle will cache each compiled query so that they don't have to be parsed with every execution. If you run a query 100 times, but with a different value concatenated per execution, then Oracle thinks each of those is a fresh, new, unique query and compiles and caches it separately, expending more effort and using 100 times more memory than if you had bound correctly. This also inhibits scalability, with respect to the number of users/apps that can access the database, as compiling new queries holds internal latches for longer periods on the cache, a shared data structure. Most of the time it even harms performance at the individual query level as well. And of course security is the biggie that everyone talks about (SQL injection).  
  
You also just plain have more bugs if you concatenate parameters. I like to show my coworkers that if you search our company's Jira issue tracking system for bugs containing words like ""single quote"" or ""apostrophe"" or a certain one of our customer's names that happens to contain an apostrophe, you'll see that historically we've had dozens and dozens of bug tickets due to concatenation of parameters. The bugs usually get ""fixed"" by escaping the single quotes, but the devs really should just parameterize their queries, and they won't even have to worry about it. It's absurd that some folks just don't use the means provided to us to bind these parameters that erase ALL of these bugs with zero effort. I'd say it's less than zero effort even, as it's actually easier to code this way!
  
Parameterization is almost always (about 99+% of the time) the right way to go, and even though I'm reluctant to say 100%, you should always default to it, unless you've identified a specific problem with it and really know what you're doing. In fact it's the single means provided to you buy the folks who made the software (database, drivers, APIs, etc.). They say ""here, please parameterize by using THIS feature!"" yet not everybody listens. Concatenating is circumventing this very means provided to you, and can potentially have a ton of negative repercussions.  
  
Database experts, DBAs, and doc writers/developers of the aforementioned software have been trying to instill into users of their software to do it right for years and years. Sometimes they passionately scold, beg, or plead. Somehow, they aren't heard often enough and it's a huge, widespread problem.  
  
Here's one example from the psycopg (Postgres adapter for Python) documentation that I personally like: 

>Never, never, NEVER use Python string concatenation (+) or string parameters interpolation (%) to pass variables to a SQL query string. Not even at gunpoint.  
  
(Source: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html#passing-parameters-to-sql-queries)  
  
And here's a quote from Tom Kyte (u/tkyte), the now-retired Oracle guru/author who taught me the subject of  databases when I first read his Oracle books in the early 2000s. He used to run the Q&A site AskTom, and would sometimes lose his patience after repeating for the umpteenth time that you need to bind your parameters:

Dont chat about how to fix it until we are done. just say.. I need your help offline. Or... there is a non sprint goal fire i have to put out, I'll create cards accordingly. End of stand up.

You're probably in an open office and chat throughout the day, this morning meet is to just let your team know where you will be messing stuff up in case they have issues with messing it up themselves.

30 mins every 2 weeks (end of sprint). Usually us just saying, things went awesome. Nobody came and asked us to do anything non sprint related because my 'manager' blocked them / is the go to. 


+30 minutes for a demo, if we have one. Keep it simple: the code is irrelevant, the concept and use are the important part.

Planning (monday after retro) 


1 hour easy. More if stakeholders are there. 

20 mins: That stuff we prevented you from being bothered with... that's gotta be done now. Score it.

30 mins: what can we do this sprint.

10 mins: what, of what we can do, should go into the goal as... WILL BE DONE no questions asked.

People in IT fields seem to constantly have this fear that they might have to take their 2-5 years of additional relevant job experience, and have to go through the trouble of finding a more senior job that pays better, with a better culture-fit, and more interesting projects. What actually ends up happening is that they inevitably jump ship anyway, and all the weird hacks and tricks they put into their code in the name of ""job-security"" end up as a genuine nightmare for someone that's probably not qualified to  understand even a fraction of the problems being solved, nor the reasoning behind such convoluted approaches.

If you can take that next job after learning a healthy set of useful skills and good design patterns, that's only better for you.

3512,talk_nerdy_too_me,"I haven’t dealt much with indexes, but I imagine its like having two tables that can be related with a primary key. For example, suppose you have a table with book authors and a numerical author ID (e.g. Say author = Tom Clancy and the author ID is ‘1’). Another table would have a list of book titles by all the authors listed in the first table along with the author ID (e.g. book title = The Hunt for Red October and, in a second column the author ID = 1). Since Tom Clancy has written many books there would be multiple rows in the second table with author ID = 1. 

So dropping the primary key (author ID) in this case means you can no longer figure out which author wrote which book(s).

Changing the primary key would be less obvious as you could still select an author ID and identify related books (but the wrong ones - e.g. swap the author ID for a different value; like change 1 to 5 - perhaps you end up pulling books by Mark Twain)

Again - not convinced this applies to an index, but if you have an index then you probably have piles of data and somewhere inside would be primary keys.","<div class=""md""><p>I haven’t dealt much with indexes, but I imagine its like having two tables that can be related with a primary key.

3620,digicow,"Basically, the ORM (perl DBIx) lets you write methods that take a resultset and return a resultset.

So I write something like:

    sub for_user($self, $user) {
      return $self->search(
        {
          'event_registrations.user_id' => $user->id
        }, {
          join => 'event_registrations'
        }
      );
    }
    
    sub of_type($self, $type) {
      return $self->search(
        {
          'event_type.activity_type_id' => $type->id
        }, {
          join => 'event_type'
        }
      );
    }
    
    sub on_date($self, $date) {
      return $self->search({\['DATE(scheduled_start) = ?' => DateTime::Format::MySQL->format_date($date)],});
    }

This creates 3 filters (`for_user`, `of_type` and `on_date`) that I can use anywhere else in my code, together or separately.

So I can write:

    $c->model('Event')->for_user($u)

And that would give me a resultset containing all Events that belong to the user $u.

Or I could do

    $c->model('Event')->for_user($u)->of_type($t)

This chains together the two filters to give me the Events for $u that are of type $t.

And I can go one further and add the date filter on, too:

    $c->model('Event)->for_user($u)->of_type($t)->on_date($d)

Chaining is fun!

But there's more! Those same filters can be invoked on resultsets that already exist, not just the ""main"" one.

    $u->events->of_type($t)

This gets all of a user's events, and then filters them to type $t (same as our second chain above)

Or with my earlier example, you could have these filters come from an HTTP request, and each one is optional:

    sub list($self) {
      my $rs = $self->role_filtered_resultset();
      $rs = $rs->on_date($self->param('date') if($self->param('date'));
      $rs = $rs->of_type($self->param('type') if($self->param('type'));
      $rs = $rs->for_user($self->param('user') if($self->param('user'));
      return $rs;
    }

This one doesn't look like chaining, but that's still what's happening when multiple params are given. The eventual query that's constructed could contain any or all of these filters in its WHERE clause, depending on what the web request contains.

The point is that it results in being able to write a lot of very small, simple bits of code, and then combine them together to easily generate complex queries","<div class=""md""><p>Basically, the ORM (perl DBIx) lets you write methods that take a resultset and return a resultset.</p>

<p>This creates 3 filters (<code>for_user</code>, <code>of_type</code> and <code>on_date</code>) that I can use anywhere else in my code, together or separately.</p>

<p>So I can write:</p>

<pre><code>$c-&gt;model(&#39;Event&#39;)-&gt;for_user($u)
</code></pre>

<p>And that would give me a resultset containing all Events that belong to the user $u.</p>

<p>Or I could do</p>

<pre><code>$c-&gt;model(&#39;Event&#39;)-&gt;for_user($u)-&gt;of_type($t)
</code></pre>

<p>This chains together the two filters to give me the Events for $u that are of type $t.</p>

<p>And I can go one further and add the date filter on, too:</p>

<pre><code>$c-&gt;model(&#39;Event)-&gt;for_user($u)-&gt;of_type($t)-&gt;on_date($d)
</code></pre>

<p>Chaining is fun!</p>

<p>But there&#39;s more! Those same filters can be invoked on resultsets that already exist, not just the &quot;main&quot; one.</p>

<pre><code>$u-&gt;events-&gt;of_type($t)
</code></pre>

<p>This gets all of a user&#39;s events, and then filters them to type $t (same as our second chain above)</p>

<p>Or with my earlier example, you could have these filters come from an HTTP request, and each one is optional:</p>

<pre><code>sub list($self) {
  my $rs = $self-&gt;role_filtered_resultset();
  $rs = $rs-&gt;on_date($self-&gt;param(&#39;date&#39;) if($self-&gt;param(&#39;date&#39;));
  $rs = $rs-&gt;of_type($self-&gt;param(&#39;type&#39;) if($self-&gt;param(&#39;type&#39;));
  $rs = $rs-&gt;for_user($self-&gt;param(&#39;user&#39;) if($self-&gt;param(&#39;user&#39;));
  return $rs;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This one doesn&#39;t look like chaining, but that&#39;s still what&#39;s happening when multiple params are given. The eventual query that&#39;s constructed could contain any or all of these filters in its WHERE clause, depending on what the web request contains.</p>

<p>The point is that it results in being able to write a lot of very small, simple bits of code, and then combine them together to easily generate complex queries</p>

Developers who can master very complex languages like C# or Java are too lazy to learn a little bit about a core component of their stack - the database. They don't understand and don't want to learn SQL, so they pick a fully fledged ORM like EntityFramework or Spring Data and think it'll fill in for their incompetence. The problem is, it won't.

Just last week I've seen code do basically this:

    var correctionAmount = results.Where(d => d.InvoiceType == ""Correction"").Sum(d => d.Amount);

Sure looks great on paper, everything seems fine here. Except that results list had 2 million rows, and this code took several minutes to run, because all of that data had to be fetched from database, only to filter on one field for a small number of rows and compute a SUM over another field. `SELECT SUM(Amount) FROM invoices WHERE InvoiceType = 'Correction'` took less than 1 second on that very same database, wasted no CPU, no memory, no network bandwidth. Remove that `.ToList()` call and you're good, you just need to know what the implications of these calls are on the underlying database.

Sure, EF and LINQ are amazing, and will translate that call to exactly the same query. But you need to know what you're doing.

3646,jringstad,"I've worked at a company where everything was done in postgres stored procedures, with a fairly thin golang microservice in front of it that basically just acted as an API gateway into postgres (so there were just a bunch of HTTP handlers that then each just did a very minor amount of pre-processing on the incoming request and then straight-up called a postgres function that would do the rest. The go part would also convert exceptions from postgres back into HTTP responses etc)

Tables had triggers on them that would append rows to other tables which were used as message-queues, which another service would then pick up (for instance there was a table to send mails, and if you wanted to send one, you'd append a row to that table and a microservice would poll that table and handle a new row by forwarding it to mailgun or whatever)


It was actually quite nice and everything was really transactionally safe. Almost everything was following the event-sourcing model and was append-only, with views and async materialized views for some things, and we could upgrade the stored procedures atomically with the data-model, so it created a very unified, safe environment in a sense. You could put a bunch of assertions at the end of your code/data migration, and have the upgrade roll back if things didn't conform to your expectations. Debuggability wasn't a major issue with postgres stored procedures.

However I would imagine it'd be quite difficult to really scale this up (which we never had to do at that company) since everything is quite tightly coupled. Both in terms of the team-size (since tables are the contract between two services in this world, they are very tightly coupled) and on the data/request scale side. We also didn't have a very thought-out solution for how to do database migrations and that often ended up being pretty painful. All-in-all it was surprisingly really not terrible, but I also probably wouldn't really recommend this approach.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve worked at a company where everything was done in postgres stored procedures, with a fairly thin golang microservice in front of it that basically just acted as an API gateway into postgres (so there were just a bunch of HTTP handlers that then each just did a very minor amount of pre-processing on the incoming request and then straight-up called a postgres function that would do the rest.

Sure, someone learning python and databases on day 1 should just straight query the database. But day 2 should definitely start learning ORMs. This is why that redditor could only find info about ORMs... because they’re kind of important. 

Your comment mentions putting GUIs on top of SQL queries and whatnot... and this is fine if you’re the lone person creating this, maintaining it, and using it for personal use. However, if you’re creating an application that other people use (I.e. customers), your company needs to maintain past your employment, or other developers might need to add things too... you use an ORM. Anything less than that would be technical debt that a developer will have to completely overhaul in the future.


Again, sure, an analyst can write a query and never need an ORM. Would it make their life easier? Yes but that’s not the point.
