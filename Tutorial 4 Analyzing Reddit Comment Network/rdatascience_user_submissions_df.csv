Hoping someone can give me some wisdom. 
I'm coming from a finance background and want to make a career change into Data Science and AI. I currently have offers from different universities to either do a BSc in it (would be my second one, I have a finance BA already), or for a conversion degree (MSc).

My initial thought was to calculate both the lift and odds ratio between the product to recommend (X) and the other products in the same cluster (Y, Z, ...), and from there find the products that are the most correlated with X. 

Another idea would be to calculate the causality between each product in the cluster and X, by finding the average treatment effect that a customer having bought Y or Z in the past, has on them buying product X.

The idea is that I'll have an agent that needs to choose the best action, where each action has both a value and a risk (the probability the action will return the value). I can calculate the risk easily, my challenge has been with the value.

These actions all involve multiple attributes; one possible solution is to define the value of these actions as a weighted sum of the value given by each attribute, and then, using hypothetical scenarios, have the stakeholders rank which actions are preferred.

action1 = w1\*v(a1\_1) + w2\*v(a1\_2) + ...

We can present the stakeholders with questions like: ""in the example above, which action should the agent choose?"". Based on the answers, I can create a list of expressions like this:

action1 > action2

action2 > action3

action4 < action1

.....

Which can be translated as:

w1\*v(a1\_1) + w2\*v(a1\_2) + ... > w1\*v(a2\_1) + w2\*v(a2\_2) + ...

As the individual values for each attribute can be calculated, I can then use this collection of expressions to try to find the values for the weights that satisfy said expressions.

We can present the stakeholders with questions like: ""in the example above, which action should the agent choose?"". Based on the answers, I can create a list of expressions like this:

action1 > action2

action2 > action3

action4 < action1

.....

Which can be translated as:

w1\*v(a1\_1) + w2\*v(a1\_2) + ... > w1\*v(a2\_1) + w2\*v(a2\_2) + ...

As the individual values for each attribute can be calculated, I can then use this collection of expressions to try to find the values for the weights that satisfy said expressions.

The idea is that I'll have an agent that needs to choose the best action, where each action has both a value and a risk (the probability the action will return the value). I can calculate the risk easily, my challenge has been with the value.

These actions all involve multiple attributes; one possible solution is to define the value of these actions as a weighted sum of the value given by each attribute, and then, using hypothetical scenarios, have the stakeholders rank which actions are preferred. For example, let's say we have two actions:

action1 = w1\*v(a1\_1) + w2\*v(a1\_2) + ...

action2 = w1\*v(a2\_1) + w2\*v(a2\_2) + ...

Essentially the business is a team that provides technical support to customers, and they need help optimizing the distribution of new support tickets among the specialists (think something like a contact center, but the support is via email and not phone).

Today they have a static rules engine that distribute these tickets based on different factors (mainly the specialist's current backlog and local time, priority of the new ticket, how many tickets a specialist already received today, etc.), and to me it seems that a RL could not just learn these static rules, but also learn new patterns that us humans would miss.

So far I've tried a simple Deep Q Learning model, that uses as reward the inverse of the total time it took for the specialist to provide an answer to the customer (so the faster the response, the higher the reward). The problem is that the reward space is highly sparse, as a ticket can be assigned to just one specialist, so there's no way to calculate what the reward would be if that ticket was instead assigned to another specialist.

This is the match: [https://youtu.be/sqVjW0wosLY?t=1828](https://youtu.be/sqVjW0wosLY?t=1828)

The round I want to discuss is the second pistol round, the link above should take you there but in case it doesnt, it´s around 30-31min mark.

So in short, Astralis is on the CT side, fallen kills device top mid, meanwhile gla1ve is top babana but falls back to inside the bombsite B. MiBR returns banana, takes control of it and show presence to Astralis (mostly to keep the CTs on B). At this point they decide to return to A (meanwhile the Ts in A havent shown presence by making no noise or peeking), and glaive, without any information whatsoever, rotates to A alongisde Xyp9x, effectively stacking A and winning the round.

Sorry for the wall of text, but it´s such a unique round... Any ideas of what led gla1ve to rotate and stack A?

TL:DR. I'm building an analytical platform to offer prediction and information to decision maker to run their business better and increase profit. A friend is impress by what I have setup and want to join me. He say that retail industries reporting and sales visualization is terrible and we could offer better visualization and reporting. Initially agree that we could work together. He kept wanting to retrofit retail industries software reporting into my platform and say it should be the initial goal. I strongly disagree since I say it's not the goal of my platform and I don't believe there's much money to be made by offering yet another Power BI. While I will be offering visualization for forecasting, trend, prediction, my goal is WHAT WILL HAPPEN based on WHAT HAPPENED. It's not to show a up to the pennies/quantity how much money they made yesterday and having them use this to generate report for invoice, billing and else. I want my future user to use my platform to understand trend, customer behavior, seasonality. By selling my platform as an investment and a tool (that replace bias humans) I'm able to charge a lot more than basic visualization which will enable me to invest heavily into R&D to further improve the quality of my prediction (I'm expecting a pay roles of 1M$ for statistician, behavioral psychologist, marketing/ads expert, math graduate and else)  . He say we could do both and that what customer want right now (yet another nice looking dashboard). But I strongly disagree that combining both is the things to do for the following reason:  


\-If I show them the visualization and the prediction/forecasting (what they want vs what they need), they won't understand the pricing and ask me well I don't need forecasting we do it ourselves,  just give us the visualization. I feel this will most likely cannibalize my product.  
\-By offering a visualization you are again seen as a administrative expense. I will have a hard time justifying the pricing of my platform against a Power BI/Tableau for peoples that don't understand yet the importance of prediction and forecasting.  


I feel like we are just seeing things differently and have fundamental difference. He work with client and want to offer what they ask so he can do money right away and reduce risk. I'm an entrepreneur, I'm building something they don't presently request (because they have no idea it remotely possible) and I'm willing to face difficulty and challenge.

Context if peoples are interested:  


I've been working in IT for the past 15 years in different roles (support, integration, cybersecurity, business analyst, it analyst, sql,...) mainly revolving around the retail industries. After noticing the lack of real analytics and seeing decision maker using always the same old inaccurate prediction, I had the idea 7 years ago to offer real analytics to the retail market. The idea has been brewing in my head ever since. All the features that I wanted were documented and research by me and I have a clear vision of what I see as the future.  


Now: unable to find a developer to partner with me and with the arrival of ChatGPT, I started a few months ago to build the necessary skills to reach my goal. I learned Python, pandas, started to build models on existing data, identify/develop/implement my future software architecture. I now have a fully functional lab with Apache Sparks/Hive on Yarn/Hdfs cluster, gpu cluster for Nvidia Rapids processing, Kafka for real-time streaming from customer site, and blablabla, Apache Superset/Dash Plotly web service for visualization.

-Pycharm and Dataspell
-Sql Server 2022 Dev

So here’s the possible solutions I came up with so far

-Dual-boot Ubuntu along Windows 11 to natively support Rapids. 
Cons: it break my flow by forcing me to switch between OS for different workload. I also lose access to SQL while under Ubuntu

-Transfer RTX 3080 ti to secondary HP workstation (i7-4790, 16gb) and connect remotely to it like a cluster. Cons: loosing 3080 TI on main machine and I might not have enough ram to fully use 12gb (according to Nvidia I should have 2:1 ratio minimum)

-Activate WSL since the performance hit is almost nothing (if someone as a source would love this idea)

-Fully transfer to Ubuntu, it support SQL Server 2022 Dev, pycharm and dataspell and fix all your problems. Cons: feel free to provide them

i'm just putting this out there so peoples don't lose 3 hours like I just did.

Let's say you transfer pfsense with VLAN (WAN eth0/0, VLANA on eth0/1, VLANB on eth0/1, VLANC on eth0/1) into Hyper-V.

Network configuration: 4 external v-switch (i350-t4, not shared with host), 1 for WAN and 3 for LAN. Backup/restore and remap WAN to HN0, LAN to HN1. Done deal right? Apparently not.

You need to do the following:

\-Create external V-switch in Virtual Switch Manager on physical port

\-Add the same virtual switch 3 times on the VM

\-Check ''enable virtual lan ident'' and tagged each of the 3 to A, B and C.

Then they will appear as HN1, HN2 and HN3 in PFSENSE. Assign them to each interface and don't configure VLAN.

About me: 35 yo, I’ve been playing rainbow six franchise since 2003 ( rainbow six 3 and black arrow on XBL, Rainbow Six Vegas 2). Was playing heavily when game came out in 2015. Took a few years off, came back on/off and has been back for about a month full-time. I consider myself a natural leader and bringing the best in everyone.

Here’s the TL;DR of what i’m looking for.


-Headset w/ mic and communication is an absolute must (absolutely no chatting beside tactical reason to use it)

-18 years old +

-Positive attitude, willingness to improve, tolerate that we might have bad day, slump, less experimented player,…

-<75ms ping, EST, availability to train/play at night (7-8ish to 10-11ish) including some weekend.

Here’s what you don’t need:

-A perfect knowledge of every maps. But you should have a good knowledge of most maps (being able to mentally visualize most maps)

-Crazy god like aiming

-Being negative or talking down to other team member. If anyone on the team ever talk down to someone during a match he will be instantly asked to leave the match (even if it’s the most important match of the season). This will be considered last warning and next time you will be out. There’s absolutely zero tolerance for toxicity.

Here’s what you need:

-Willingness to win or lose as a team. Helping each other, watching your buddy’s back, giving positive tips to team members.

I've made a dashboard analysing macroeconomic factors since the previous election.

I want to share the results and hear your feedback and development thoughts. I.e how you would have visualised this data differently

The results are concerning as some metrics such as inflation are literally coming off the chart. All of the statistics shown are from the Reserve Bank and reliable official sources. This project was really rewarding and reporting the truth feels empowering. Hopefully Zimbabwe can turn it after these upcoming elections.

I wanted to bring your attention to the upcoming elections in Zimbabwe scheduled for this Wednesday. The past election raised significant concerns due to allegations of unfairness, including claims of collusion between the electoral commission and the ruling party to manipulate results using Excel files, an issue that has been dubbed ""Excelgate.""

Taking a closer look at the available data on the official website, I've stumbled upon some noteworthy findings. These findings have prompted me to write an article on LinkedIn, where I explore how they tie into the broader 'Excelgate' narrative. Additionally, I delve into the steps citizens have been taking to ensure the integrity of their votes during the upcoming election.

For those who are interested, you can read the article and share your perspectives. I'm always open to hearing different viewpoints and engaging in constructive discussions.

I wanted to bring your attention to the upcoming elections in Zimbabwe scheduled for this Wednesday. The past election raised significant concerns due to allegations of unfairness, including claims of collusion between the electoral commission and the ruling party to manipulate results using Excel files, an issue that has been dubbed ""Excelgate.""

Taking a closer look at the available data on the official website, I've stumbled upon some noteworthy findings. These findings have prompted me to write an article on LinkedIn, where I explore how they tie into the broader 'Excelgate' narrative. Additionally, I delve into the steps citizens have been taking to ensure the integrity of their votes during the upcoming election.

For those who are interested, you can read the article and share your perspectives. I'm always open to hearing different viewpoints and engaging in constructive discussions.

As the elections approach, I wanted to share a dashboard I've created to visualize our country's economic performance since the last election. While there have been improvements in certain sectors since 2018, the overall results are concerning, especially when it comes to inflation, unemployment, and exchange rates. It's evident that these issues are a result of unfulfilled promises, backed by data from reputable sources like Zimstat and RBZ.

In 2022, the diaspora sent back a record-breaking 2 BILLION dollars to Zimbabwe. While this reflects unwavering support, it is painfully unsustainable. We all long for prosperity to return to our nation.

Witnessing the impact on the ground is disheartening, particularly when inflation rates seem to defy all expectations. It's natural to feel demoralized and powerless in such circumstances. Yet, let's hold onto hope and strive for free and fair elections this time around, as they could be the much-needed catalyst for real progress and positive change.

While I understand that the team at Santa Monica may wish to take a break from Norse mythology, I have a hard time believing that they are going to abandon it for good. There are 3 major reasons why I think so:

1. Throughout GOW 2018 a lot of effort was put into building up the image of Odin as an ultimate master-mind villain, from the main story, to Mimir's tales and side quests, all without having even seen Odin once or heard his voice. It would seem irresponsible to me to throw Odin in in the next game and have him dead or otherwise made obscure by the end of it.
2. The events of Ragnarok are so much richer in number and scope than the myth of Baldur. Trying to cover the events of Ragnarok from beginning to end would inevitably make the game feel rushed, and seems like a poor design decision from my point of view.
3. The main story of the game is meant to take about the same length of time to complete as GOW 2018, which reinforces my point above. I don't see how one could do justice to the stories of Ragnarok with only up to \~30 hours of gameplay.

Would do you guys think about this? Given that we are confirmed to meet Tyr, who was able to travel between different pantheons, and knowing that Odin himself was aware of other pantheon's existence and events surrounding them, could it be that this could lead to some kind of dynamic meta-mythological universe by the end of this game? By this I mean that, even if we end up in Egypt, what would be happening in Egypt would still happen in parallel with the events of Ragnarok, perhaps even impacting one another?

I've received one offer for a program in Scientific Computing at Cambridge, which consists of a one-year Master's and 3 years of research. The course/centre is formally part of the Department of Physics, but the projects are from all STEM fields, with a major focus on computing and materials modelling.

I've also gotten an offer from a very reputable university (but not as much in physics) in London with a relatively well-known supervisor and for a very exciting project in non-equilibrium condensed matter theory. The possible project directions are mostly analytical, but if I find myself attracted to computation I can always explore topics like DMRG, which I wouldn't otherwise be able to at Cambridge. It's hard for me to think of a more exciting project than this one. However, it seems a little foolish to dismiss an offer from Cambridge.

I was wondering if it could be a good idea to go with Cambridge and leave after getting the Master's if I end up having a change of heart. This would give me another year to decide which PhD to pursue and would possibly make me more competitive next admission's cycle. I've also applied for condensed matter theory at Cambridge and Oxford this year, but didn't get an offer from either despite having no weaknesses in my application (according to the feedback I received). I believe it was my non-Oxbridge undergraduate education which ultimately prevented me from securing an offer, so getting a degree from Cambridge should give me another, much better chance at securing a place next year. 

I would also get a chance to apply to top US universities, where the most ground-breaking research in condensed matter is being done. One major difference is in the length of PhD programmes, which coupled with a year spent at Cambridge would offset me by at least 3 years in getting the doctorate. I was told this isn't necessarily a bad thing if my aim would be to stay in academia, as it would allow me to produce more research before starting a postdoc, helping avoid the postdoc trap. However, I'm not sure what admission's panels in theoretical physics would think about someone who chose to spend a year on a Master's in scientific computing instead of something more directly related to theoretical physics.

I'm also seeking guidance on what steps I should take next to strengthen my profile. I'm very confused right now. Should I focus on more deep learning projects to dive deeper into machine learning? Are cloud and database technologies essential skills that I should be acquiring? Is mastering leetcode beneficial even for roles in data science? Alternatively, are there any other areas that I might be overlooking?

I'm primarily interested in having a daily routine, something I can practice everyday. Where do I start and has anybody ever used flashcards for this?

While I was feeling the pain, I also had symptoms of low testosterone like ED, low libido, depression and fatigue. During the past couple days, I didn't feel fatigue or depression, but I still feel low libido and have ED.  I never had any worn-like veins in my testicles though, perhaps my varicocele was not a severe one. But I still want to have the surgery done hoping that could cure my ED (ED onset almost at the same time when varicocele appeared).

——————————————————

Hi all, I held 2 Bachelor degrees in Stats and Econ, but with an overall gpa of 2.84 (got burnout by pursuing 2 degrees during undergrad, I should focus on one degree instead). I have about 3-years exp in 2 faang companies as a data analyst contractor. I want to advance my career and apply to this program. I know the admission is strict about gpa, so I spent half year to strengthen my application by doing the following to offset my low gpa:

1.Took prerequisite courses in local community college and aced all of them, including oop, data structure, linear algebra. (The application separately asked for letter grades for Data Structure course and Algorithm course each, but the course I took in CC was called “Data Structure” and covered both topics in data structure and algo analysis. I just fill-in the boxes with the same course, not sure if that will cause problems)

2.Passed the ds&a proficiency exam with an A

3.Had 3 strong LoR, 2 from cs professors and 1 from math professor. They are all from my prerequisite courses.

4.Had a strong SoP edited by an expert, I talked about how my work exp and edu background can fit into the program and I will be benefited from the program, and slightly mentioned why my gpa was low… 

I believe there’s nothing more I can do at this point. If I still get rejected, I might need to pursue a cs certificate or post-bacc in order to show I’m capable of handling graduate level courses.

I just submitted my application yesterday. I also applied to multiple online cs master programs too, but still feel anxious upon waiting for the results.

Lets say I have a dataset where one of the independent variables is a  categorical variable with a small # of possible values, and I want to do some predictions. So i split the data in train/test, and do one hot encoding(or any other method) for the categorical variables.

&#x200B;

There are 2 scenarios I'm unclear on:

&#x200B;

1) if I want to run some feature importance ranking algorithms( such as using random forests ,logistic regression, or permutation importance)  on the training set, how does it work with a categorical variable(especially if its one hot encoded). Like I'd see a different score for each one hot encoded category, and its unclear whether this is valid and how to interpret this ranking.

When calculation the sample size for a z or t test, we might use a formula like this(depending on the test)

I know some statisticians used to say we would start off with an guess of STD and use it to calculate some n.

Then we use a pilot study with this n and see if the sample STD of the pilot is the same as our initial guess of STD; if not, we recalculate our final n, which will then be used in the final study.

&#x200B;

But when I hear data scientists talk about AB testing some online features for a website/app/email, I've never heard anything about pilot studies. Never mentioned in any guide or tutorial. So in practice, what is done by these data scientists for these online RCTs for calculating the STD?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1)what exactly is a  minimum detectable effect ?  I've seen it defined as ""  the effect size set by the researcher that an impact evaluation is designed to estimate for a given level of significance. The minimum detectable effect is a critical input for [power calculations](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Sample_Size_and_Power_Calculations) and is closely related to power, sample size, and [survey and project budgets](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Survey_Budget).  "",(from [https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Minimum\_Detectable\_Effect](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Minimum_Detectable_Effect)) but haven't seen like an equation whenever its described.

&#x200B;

for a 1 sample z test, (X\_bar-mu)/SD is an effect size ; 

and for a 2 sample :(X1-X2)/SD

&#x200B;

and when doing sample size calculations, like the following:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3sbd61hzia1b1.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=49acd60d8ecd1ac5124a2034006898163a765e2c

 you might set a certain d and sigma  for the calculation, so then the (mu-mu\_0)/sigma we would be using in this equation is this the MDE?

&#x200B;

 2)For 2 sided tests, to achieve the same effect and power as a 1 sided test with the same alpha, you would need a bigger sample size.

&#x200B;

Modern packages often show both the F test and t test results. My question is, how to approach this?

Heya dudes I played runescape in about 2008 for a few years when I was a kid an loved it. Anyways like some of you I'm sure I then didn't touch the game until the pandemic started almost three years back. I decided to start playing runescape again and decided to pick RS3 as it seemed new and exciting! Ive been a fairly regular player now for about three years and have done quite well for myself in the game, a few 99s a few mil but nothing out of this world. However I would like to make the transition to OSRS because I've found the game super frustrating atm.

I grew up in a fairly archaic household where something like ADHD was brushed off as "" lazy kids who can't pay attention and are too hyper"". I **always** found it hard to concentrate in school (except for mathematics classes).  I  never once thought It could be ADHD. I have always been fairly high achieving and studied mathematics at an elite university and landed a good job after university and this arrogance and success led me to believe I couldn't have ADHD as it was always portrayed to me as something badly-behaved naughty children had. I apologize for this primitive opinion.  I just assumed I had a hard time concentrating because "" my brain was just too fast for boring things"". 

I suffered terrible anxiety my entire life, mainly depersonalisation and disassociation disorders. I have been in therapy for a year around this and it was always thought to be a symptom of childhood trauma and again because ""my brain was just too fast."" 

 I smoked since the age of 14 and heavily since 16. I quit 3 weeks ago, ever since I put out the last cigarette  I have found my ability to concentrate diminished hugely and can barely even focus on my work. I thought this was getting quite bad and my very supportive and more modern, liberal girlfriend (of 3 years)  told me she has **always** suspected I have ADHD.   This morning I went to the doctor and was (finally?)  diagnosed with fairly severe ADHD. 

My questions are this:

1) Did smoking help my ADHD all these years? 

2) Is there a connection with ADHD and anxiety? If so should I focus on curing the anxiety which will remove the ADHD or curing the ADHD which will remove the anxiety? I feel like the connection with them both is my absolute inability to be still or have an empty mind which then rushes itself with panic and disassociation. 

I apologize if this is an overly simplistic plan of attack, my education, and knowledge of ADHD is only about 40 minutes old.

In my journey so far, I have come across several occasions where lack of data was a major setback.  

&#x200B;

I am sure we all can agree that data annotation is a very time and resource consuming task. This can take up-to weeks and countless hours of reviewing to come up with useable data. This has led to explore solutions where I can somehow automate this or have some sort of mechanism which will allow me to generate maximum amount of quality data by spending minimum amount of time.  

&#x200B;

With that being said, a thought of a prompt guided annotation tool has come to surface.   

This will solve for the following problems. 

1. Prompt guided annotation instead of human guided labelling.
2. 2 Real time feedback and error correction. 
3. Can be hosted locally to maintain data privacy.
4. Will support vision and text annotation to start with.

My intension behind putting out this post is to understand, 

1. If this will be a project worth pursuing.
2. Will this actually solve a problem at scale for the community.

I have been working professionally for the past 1 year. My work is centered around document intelligence and computer vision stuff. In my journey so far, I have come across several occasions where lack of data was a major setback.

I am sure we all can agree that data annotation is a very time and resource consuming task. This can take up-to weeks and countless hours of reviewing to come up with useable data. This has let to explore solutions where I can somehow automate this or have some sort of mechanism which will allow me to generate maximum amount of quality data by spending minimum amount of time.

With that being said, a thought of a prompt guided annotation tool has come to surface. This will solve for the following problems.

1. Prompt guided annotation instead of human guided labelling.
2. Real time feedback and error correction.
3. Can be hosted locally to maintain data privacy.
4. Will support vision and text annotation to start with.

My intension behind putting out this post is to understand

1. If this will be a project worth pursing.
2. Will this actually solve a problem at scale for the community.
3. If the first 2 answers are yes, then I would love to collaborate to scope this better and build some cool stuff!!

But how do I deal with data in the middle area? do I form a third class for this? the result of the prediction is of course much worse as a result if I am going to create more classes.

The problem is that the data correspond to a normal distribution and i don't have a clear distinction between class 1 and middle or class 2 and middle.

Or is it legitimate to omit the data from the middle for the training and then later simply predict class 1 or class 2 and also show the probability of this?

I understand the T+2 settlement period and rules that come with it as applies to a cash account... my understanding is that these rules also apply to margin accounts but a margin account will allow you borrow from your brokerage so as to not use unsettled funds and avoid these violations. (1) Is this presumption correct or do these rules simply only apply to cash accounts? (2) If they do apply to margin accounts, then is a purchase automatically made on margin once the account runs out of settled funds? Say I open the day with $0 cash available for investment, and I sell stock AAA for $1000. Later that same day, a small cap stock BBB that I’ve been watching starts to spike in price and I want in. I know I can buy in with the unsettled funds, but I also know that I’m going to sell the same day since I don’t think it’ll sustain this increase. (3) With a cash account, there’s no way to do this without incurring a GFV, right? (4) And in the same scenario with a margin account, how would I go about making this trade without a GFV...

Now, doing this still plays sound from the speakers since it's a combo amp, which I don't want since the whole objective is quiet playing. So, I have a cable plugged into the effects return connected to nothing on the other end. Effectively, I'm just using my amp's preamp with the Radar. I can't just use the raw output of the amp with a load box because it's a combo amp.

I've watched a video from Pete Thorn on impulse responses and he noted that if you're playing through a tube amplifier with the speaker disconnected this will blow the amp because it needs to distribute the load somewhere, e.g. a load box. After hearing this, I wanted to make sure that plugging an empty cable into my effects return isn't harmful to the amplifier.

I have 30-40 degrees set to 20% fan speed. This keeps the GPU at a pretty constant 37-38 degrees during non-gaming use, meaning that the fans are at a constant 20% speed.

Thing is, I can hear the fans stopping and starting about once every second. I have confirmed this visually. Even though Afterburner has them recorded as staying at a constant 20%, they are stopping and starting constantly. Normally I wouldn't care but when I'm studying, I can hear it constantly droning which gets annoying.

Any solutions/recommendations appreciated.

**EDIT:** I fixed the issue by setting the minimum fan speed on the curve to 30% instead of 20. This didn't really add any noise at all and kept the fans running at a relatively constant RPM. For anything 25% or below, I think the fans aren't designed to run at speeds that low so they're just programmed to turn on and off to create the same effect of having them at a lower speed.

*Edit*: I changed the PCPartPicker list to the prices I paid. A few rebates were also available, totaling to about $50, but we’ll see if I ever get around to turning those in. 
Edit 2: also forgot a huge thanks to /r/buildapcsales. Really helped me choose which parts to go with on this build and I highly suggest all interested in building a PC to browse there daily while part searching.

This is my first time posting here, so I apologise if I am out of place.

My team is currently utilising SageMaker pipelines to coordinate model training. In the past, we encountered issues where the pipeline was misconfigured during cloud execution, resulting in challenging-to-debug errors 🐛

I've been delving into the idea of using Localstack and SageMaker LocalPipelineSession to execute the pipeline locally prior to deployment on the cloud ☁️. I've successfully implemented this on my local machine, using pytest and pytest-bdd to craft integration tests 🧪

Building on that success, I've ventured into creating a GitLab CI job that runs these tests upon making a merge request. A peculiar aspect of SageMaker pipelines in a local setup is its reliance on Docker. To address this, I've designed a custom Docker image, enabling installation of Python, my dependencies, Docker, and Docker Compose. The job initialises LocalStack and executes the tests. Nevertheless, running these tests within GitLab has brought about Docker-in-Docker related challenges 🐳 It's been quite a frustrating experience... The SageMaker pipelines run, although unsuccessfully with silent errors 🤫

**My plan: is** to master the required skills such as Python, data visualization, SQL, etc., and undertake numerous projects. After that, I intend to secure an internship.

However, I want to share my story and get your feedback. 

A few years ago, I was part of an unofficial research group. No contracts or any type of payment was involved. The lead of the group was a university professor. 

During that period, a colleague and I worked on a project with a case study of a prediction model. My colleague did the machine learning model and I designed the architecture and developed a platform that consumed the model and provided results and visualisations. 

We submitted it to a competition as a group but we didn’t get the first place. 

Fast forward. I am in industry now and don’t have plans to return to academia. Found out that a few months ago, that work got published in a journal with Author 1: my colleague, Author 2: the professor and Author 3 someone external that never worked on it. 

I was never asked about it. Author 1 said that he tried to include me but Author 2 was against it since I am not part of the group anymore. There are other dependencies between the two and he didn’t want to push it more. 

It’s not an innovation or an impressive work. I never thought of publishing it. However I feel cheated. 

The code of the platform is in my personal gitlab and I have mail communications explaining to others how to install and use it. 

I don’t want to create any issue to author 1. But how do you think I should handle this?

Hot take in question: ""Sklearn is a garbage library and shouldn't be used in a professional setting.""

I feel like I should start by saying that my take might have been a bit strong. Garbage might not have been the best word to describe the entirety of the package, and it does have a few uses in a professional setting - namely the pipeline and data transformation functions. That being said, I have some issues with sklearn.

Sklearn is, as the developers put it, ""[a machine learning package](https://twitter.com/hug_nicolas/status/1167508365083369478?s=20)"". When they say it is a machine learning package, they really mean they don't care one iota about anything besides predictive accuracy. This attitude is manifested in issues like logistic regression being regularized by default, because who cares about pesky things like your parameter estimates or colinear features so long as you're getting good predictive accuracy on your test set. Never mind that colinear features might cause your model performance to fall off a cliff the moment the underlying data distribution changes, or heaven forbid if you want to do any sort of hypothesis testing. Heck they don't even give you a way to see a model summary, because after all RSME is king and we don't care about peons like p-values. In the [immortal words](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fotjm9/statsmodels_vs_sklearn_for_the_linear_models/flhe2zo/) of /u/unsteady_panda, ""SKLearn is fine if you want to yolo some predictions and call it a day"".

From a technical standpoint, sklearn also has some scale issues with dealing with larger datasets that make it not incredibly well suited for #bigdata.

Then again, maybe this is all just a big ""get off my lawn"" opinion and I need to step down from my soapbox. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this!",False,False,datascience,Hot Take: Scikit-learn,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/scjp82/hot_take_scikitlearn/

Hey you. Yes you, person asking ""how do I get a job in data science/analytics/MLE/AI whatever BS job with data in the title?"". I got news for you. There are two simple rules to getting one of these jobs.

1. Have experience.

2. Don't have no experience.

There are approximately 1000 entry level candidates who think they're qualified because they did a 24 week bootcamp for every entry level job. I don't need to be a statistician to tell you your odds of landing one of these aren't great.

**HOW DO I GET EXPERIENCE?**

Are you currently employed? If not, get a job. If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job, then put it on your resume. Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution. Talk to your supervisor about career aspirations at year-end/mid-year reviews. Maybe you'll find a way to transfer to a role internally and skip the whole resume ignoring phase. Alternatively, network. Be friends with people who are in the roles you want to be in, maybe they'll help you find a job at their company.

**WHY AM I NOT GETTING INTERVIEWS?**

IDK. Maybe you don't have the required experience. Maybe there are 500+ other people applying for the same position. Maybe your resume stinks. If you're getting 1/20 response rate, you're doing great. Quit whining. 

**IS XYZ DEGREE GOOD FOR DATA SCIENCE?**

Does your degree involve some sort of non-remedial math higher than college algebra? Does your degree involve taking any sort of programming classes? If yes, congratulations, your degree will pass most base requirements for data science. Is it the best? Probably not, unless you're CS or some really heavy math degree where half your classes are taught in Greek letters. Don't come at me with those art history and underwater basket weaving degrees unless you have multiple years experience doing something else.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ BOOTCAMP/MICROMASTERS?**

Do you have experience? No? This ain't gonna help you as much as you think it might. Are you experienced and want to learn more about how data science works? This could be helpful.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ MASTER'S IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM?**

Congratulations, doing a Master's is usually a good idea and will help make you more competitive as a candidate. Should you shell out 100K for one when you can pay 10K for one online? Probably not. In all likelihood, you're not gonna get $90K in marginal benefit from the more expensive program. Pick a known school (probably avoid really obscure schools, the name does count for a little) and you'll be fine. Big bonus here if you can sucker your employer into paying for it.

**WILL XYZ CERTIFICATE HELP MY RESUME?**

Does your certificate say ""AWS"" or ""AZURE"" on it? If not, no.

**DO I NEED TO KNOW XYZ MATH TOPIC?**

Yes. Stop asking. Probably learn probability, be familiar with linear algebra, and understand what the hell a partial derivative is. Learn how to test hypotheses. Ultimately you need to know what the heck is going on math-wise in your predictions otherwise the company is going to go bankrupt and it will be all your fault. 

**WHAT IF I'M BAD AT MATH?**

Git gud. Do some studying or something. MIT opencourseware has a bunch of free recorded math classes. If you want to learn some Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang is your guy. 

**WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD I LEARN?**

STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION. I CAN GOOGLE ""HOW TO BE A DATA SCIENTIST"" AND EVERY SINGLE GARBAGE TDS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU SQL AND PYTHON/R. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE JOY OF SEGMENTATION FAULTS TO RUN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. 

**SHOULD I LEARN PYTHON OR R?**

Both. Python is more widely used and tends to be more general purpose than R. R is better at statistics and data analysis, but is a bit more niche. 
Take your pick to start, but ultimately you're gonna want to learn both you slacker.

**SHOULD I MAKE A PORTFOLIO?**

Yes. And don't put some BS housing price regression, iris classification, or titanic survival project on it either. Next question.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO AS A PROJECT?**

IDK what are you interested in? If you say twitter sentiment stock market prediction go sit in the corner and think about what you just said. Every half brained first year student who can pip install sklearn and do model.fit() has tried unsuccessfully to predict the stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is a thing for a reason. There are literally millions of other free datasets out there you have one of the most powerful search engines at your fingertips to go find them. Pick something you're interested in, find some data, and analyze it. 

**DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?** (courtesy of /u/bikeskata)

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.

So previously, I have had this machine for almost a year and everything was ok so far.

I could play FarCry5 for about 3 hours without annoying throttling issue. Unfortunately, the mainboard was bricked so Dell has it replaced with the new one.

After getting my new mainboard, I applied the same tweaks and configurations as previous then made it under load by running both prime95 and heaven bench at the same time. As usual, I monitor the sensors using HWinfo64.
Surprisingly, I got a maximum temperature of 92C for CPU and it frequently throttled. Throttling comes from PL1. (~96C without undervolt)
I just repasted, but It doesn't get any better,
running the same stress tests still gives around 90C for CPU. In addition, GPU and Ambient temperature stay below 80C.

My previous machine can get ~49fps in heaven benchmark, but the new one just gives me ~43fps. I can't even play FC5 more than 10 minutes. I don't want to disable DPTF as I never disabled it on my previous configuration.

He also began to have blood in his urine. The Vet said she wasn't sure if he had bladder cancer or stones, but needed an x-ray and ultrasound next week to verify. 

Well, the next day he started walking sideways.  He always had severe arthritis in his back legs, but this day it was particularly bad. He still wanted to go to the park, so we went for a short 10ish minute walk. He took a COMPLETELY awful turn after walking in the park.

When we got back home he was in visible pain. Running around in circles, his legs constantly giving out, urinating, he could not lie down. His pain medicine did not help, and this continued for 45 minutes before I decided it was time.

I took him to the Emergency Vet and asked for their opinion. She said she believed it was time too. It was done, peaceful, but I feel so guilty and awful. Maybe he could have gotten a little better if I waited? Was he just tired from the park? Maybe he had a few more days? Should I have even taken him to the park one last time?

I've compiled a list of a few questions I have been asked in technical interviews. I interview specifically for Data Analyst and Scientist roles, because they are used interchangeably in some instances. Hope these help, and let me know if you have any questions at all! 

**Easier Questions (foundational):**

1. How would you NOT include two values (using the NOT IN function for this one).

2. W3schools left join vs. inner join scenario

3. Count the number of employees in each division (COUNT and GROUP BY)

4. From question 3, only include divisions with 10 or more employees (I had to use HAVING here and explain the difference between having and WHERE) 

5. Create a table with firstname, lastname, address, city, and zip

And other flavors of this. Understanding the foundational skills is so important because the MAJORITY of questions revolved around things like this. It's different when you have real-world scenarios, so get used to thinking critically.

**Intermediate(?) I know this is subjective**

1. Gather salaries that are higher than the average salaries, and show these results (subquery with something like WHERE __ > (SELECT avg(price) FROM...)

2. Find duplicate records in this table (group by records and having count(records) > 1)

3. Select every row where their is no match in the other table (LEFT JOIN IS NULL scenario)

Flavors of things like this. Nothing too complex, but instances that will require you to think much more critically.

**Misc questions**

* Explain the difference between left and right join

* What is the difference between a foreign key and primary key? Give examples

* What is the first thing you would do when a query is running slow?

* What is a view? What is a CTE?

**Data Science-ish**

* What is a p-value

* How do you just the accuracy of a linear/logistic regression model?

* How do you clean data in Python? Give examples

* What Python libraries are you familiar with (for me, it's Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn)

* Give an example of when you would use a linear/logistic regression model. What are some real world examples you can think of?

Pushing the restart button in your late 20s can be a bit scary, but I am so glad I did now.

I wanted to start fostering to cheer myself up. I loved dogs, and thought volunteering at the shelter this way would be helpful. I had no idea just how helpful it was, and I found myself fostering 7 dogs before adopting my current one. 5 of these dogs were seniors, or dogs with disabilities. I specifically asked for them because I knew how overlooked they were, and I wanted to bring them happiness. I work from home so they always were really good office buddies, and saying goodbye was bitter-sweet as you'd imagine.

I started fostering a dog named ""Bone"" 2 years ago. He was 14 years old, had arthritis in his hips+knees, and underweight. He had not the best life. In may ways, he was going to be a tough sell. He didn't care for pets, had a hard time standing for long, nephropathy that made it difficult for him to know when he had to poop, and was much more content with just existing in the same room with you. Much like a cat in dog form (lol)!

I fostered him for a few months before he found his family. Saying goodbye to him wasn't the same as the others, and I felt deep down in my stomach that I had made a mistake. To my surprise, he was brought back the next day because he had an accident in the house and the new owners were mad about that. After a bit longer fostering him, I adopted him! My first dog as an adult!

It has been a wonderful experience having him live with me. He is very much a ""one person"" type of dog, and I am that person by default lol! Although, that isn't completely true because he loves my partner, but that's about it haha! I have made a commitment to ensure he lives the rest of his days with happiness, and I have stuck with it. We go to the park every single day, we get pup cups, we pile up on the couch to play Playstation, we play tug-o-war, and we care a lot for each other. My life has revolved around him, and I made sure it was going to be that way. I have left trips early to come home because he is anxious without me.

It has certainly not been easy, nor would it be financially viable for a lot of people. I spend a lot of money each month on his supplements/medicine, and he will often have poop accidents in the middle of the night. I am usually up at midnight and 3am with him when he can feel that he has to go, but a lot of times he doesn't even know :(. I only say this, because if you're going to adopt a senior dog it's important to know that these may be a factor. However,  I know he is living the rest of his days comfortable, pain-free, and loved! That is what really matters.

I couldn't help but chuckle and think back to what I said to myself 2 years ago. I had no idea I'd have a dog, and especially not a senior one. The shelter did not expect him to be alive more than a few months at 14 years old, and now he will be 16 soon. I thought about making a post once he passed, because it would help me, but my viewpoint and relationship with death has shifted, and I know when it's time that I will accept it. I will be a blubbering mess for a while, but I couldn't imagine NOT fostering or adopting more special needs dogs in the future.

I can hear him snoring in his bed right now, cuddled up to his teddy bear. **""Please let me find meaning in anything**"" is what I thought two years ago. With tears in my eyes, I look at my snoring old man and know that I have.

* Putting the multi-rig after the dunk wall just sucked. Only 35% of people completed it (according to online), and I believe that's because the rings were absolutely soaked in mud.

* Atmosphere is pretty great (especially with some good headphones).
* The gameplay itself is fun
* The jump scares are effective
* I really liked the decisions you made, and how it displayed decisions you COULD have made. That adds replayability.
* I thought the tension was great, despite many other people's reviews.
* I liked the inclusion of other Dark Pictures games.

CONS:

* Resolution does appear low, but honestly, that never bothered me too much because I felt immersed otherwise.

* I feel very little to no haptic feedback.

* A few more technical issues than I would have liked.
* Enemy variety is not that great, despite a few cool spots which I won't spoil
* Supermassive games REALLY seems to be rushing poorly optimized games out the door. ""The Devil in Me"" was EXTREMELY poorly optimized for PC, and met with numerous game-breaking bugs on PS5.

I can see how people may or may not like it. If you liked Rush of Blood, you will like this. If $40USD feels too steep, it's totally understandable. I do find some reviewers are being a bit too harsh, but that may be because I am not overly critical of games in general.

I'm not an emotional person, but this game really tugged at my heartstrings and made me tear up. Life is really so precious and fast. Blink and you'll miss it.

The only con is that it's about 1.5 hours long, unless you want to replay it for trophies, other decisions, etc. For $15 USD, it is highly worth it, and even sits at an overwhelmingly positive review on steam with 8.8k reviews (note: the steam version just uses a webcam for the blinking mechanic, it's not a VR game on PC).

I cancelled the appointment for this reason, and the surgeon called me back and said ""This is what happens when you Google and pretend you know more than the professionals.""

Questions

1.) What can I do to help breath better? My septum is moderately deviated to the right, but breathing alternates between one nostril breathing, to none, to briefly fully open. I breath out of my mouth when I sleep, jog, and exercise which sucks. In a lot of ways, I am miserable because I literally cannot breath when I take bites of food since my mouth is busy. 

2.) Is their any interventions for ENS that are actually helpful? I read that it's between people feeling suicidal or people being able to live with it somehow.

3.) Is their any chance for a cure or re-growing of turbinates? Like stem cell?

**Easy ranked questions:**

1.) https://i.imgur.com/EcK8K0v.png

This was just a simple maximum aggregation and using the WHERE function to look for region 1. 

**Medium Ranked questions** 

1.) https://i.imgur.com/LfJhzVj.png

2.) I had to insert two tables worth of data into an already existing table. Essentially, I had to just JOIN two tables together then insert that data. I cannot find the image for this one, sorry.

3.) https://i.imgur.com/dmqh1rL.png

**Hard Ranked Questions**

1.) https://i.imgur.com/6y8BRdv.png

2.) I had to calculate a year over year change. Luckily, I asked for help in this thread and the question was quite similar to this. I had to utilize the windows function LAG for this question.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/vyaimo/how_do_i_get_the_percentage_of_a_monthtomonth/

**Misc**

1.) ""What are steps you would take if a query is running slow?""

2.) What is a CTE and why would you use it? Can you provide an example?

3.) What are some steps you would take to clean messy data? Can you give us an example?

4.) (Basically behavioral questions like): Name a time you had multiple deadlines, what is your favorite analysis project and what was the quantitative result (like x amount of business hours saved, 1000s of dollars saved, etc.), when did a project not work out as you plannewd and what was the result?

**Excel**

1.) A VLOOKUP portion (XLOOKUP GANG RISE UP THO)

2.) A tricky IF functioned portion

3.) QUARTILE function portioned

4.) A pivottable  + calculating percentages from it.


**A few thoughts:**

As you can see from last year's job, and some current jobs I am looking into, you don't have to be an expert in SQL to apply. This is not to say that advanced understandings and functions are important, but I think many people are hung up on the fact that they are not perfect in SQL, when a lot of times use cases for advanced functions are not needed (in my experience).

I thought I was strong for adopting* a senior dog and that I could handle it, but I feel so very weak these days. He is really enjoying life, and I really do make sure he has the best life possible. He is a coffee shop favorite, loves walks, gets treats/toys often, loves cuddling with me in bed, and is living a life most dogs would dream of.

But then the feeling hits that I am going to lose him soon. And then I feel guilty for feeling that way because I should be enjoying the ""now."" I really do a good job, but the invasive thoughts hit me a lot.

I'm really not sure how or what to do when I lose him. I live alone, and he's been my best buddy since I've adopted him.

Workplace is needing a network analysis of sorts, but I am confused on the logistics of how this would work. For clarity, outside of logistic/linear regression models - I have not worked with modeling much. I do know enough Python, R, Tableau, and SQL to get by.

We have a dataset of 10 million records that look like this:



Claim_ID | IP_Address | Social_Security_Number | State used in | Date Used
--------|----------|----------------------|-------------|---------
1 | 1.1.1.1 | 123456789 | AL | 2021-01-01
2 | 3.2.5.1 | 123456789 | OH | 2021-04-01

So you can see in this example, that a claim was filed witht he same social security number in 2 different states, 2 different dates, with 2 different IP Addresses.

The goal would be to have a graph that would show the SSN as a bubble, you could click that and it would show you which states it was used in, what IP addresses it was related to, etc.

It would look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/gxuTuPW

**A quick feel good story:**


[I made a few days ago about a dog that I was fostering. She was needing to find a home.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/vkcwdq/who_is_looking_for_the_sweetest_and_most_lovable/) I think she was my 7th foster dog, and I  am happy to report that today she did find a home. This story is so unbelievably sweet that I wanted to share. 

An older gentleman was very interested in adopting her. We met at the shelter, and the dog and him clicked immediatly. He told me how lonely he has been since his wife and dog passed away 2 years ago, and he's been debating about wanting another dog. He finally found the courage to try again. He has had a history of saving animals and adopting them from shelters. He begin to cry his eyes out when he met her and begin filling out the paperwork to bring her home. The adopter mentioned he has a nice house for her to run around in, a big king size bed for her to sleep on, and a nice yard/porch for her to lounge around in the country. Basically, she's going to be living the best life possible. He is retired so will be with her constantly.

I tell you this because this dog came from a rough situation. She was covered in ticks, scared to death, and had an unknown future. HES really went all out and helped her recover, and having her in my home really brought out the best in her. Dogs don't always have to have an unhappy ending, and you can help!


**How you can help:**

Have you ever wanted to foster? HES is almost at max capacity right now. Times are tough, but more fosters are definitely needed. HES provides all of the food and materials (leashes, water bowls, etc.) for the pups, and you can foster them as long as you'd like. I personally keep mine until they find a home, but if a weekend works for you that's okay too.

Dogs absolutely THRIVE when they are in a home environment. It's amazing what a little break can do for them. Please don't feel guilty if you cannot, or do not want to, foster. Please consider spaying and neutering your pets, and adopting from shelters whenever possible.

I noticed when I would leave and go to the store, coffee shop, etc. I would come home and she would be sleeping with my sandal! It was never chewed, but always near her head. I thought it was a weird quirk until...

I took off my shirt I wore all day and hung it over the laundry basket. I had to leave, with another shirt, and come back. I was gone 30 minutes.

[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/r3jseo/fostering_a_senior_dog_until_they_pass_away/)

He is my first dog I have ever adopted. I am financially in a good place, and work from home, so I thought it would be best that he stay with me. We have become quite attached, and after he was adopted last month then brought back the next day (no fault of his own), I did not think change would be good for him.

And god... let me tell you, I love this little guy. His name is Bone.

* I love that he knows what ""snuggle buggle"" is at night. He will crawl into bed with me and snuggle close. He snores louder than me.

* I love taking him to my favorite coffee shop. He gets a pup cup and is a favorite there.

* I love taking him on all sorts of hikes and walks so he can sniff everything!

* I love how he looks at me with his eyes when he wants pets. He'll also do this little thing where he slightly raises his right paw up.

* I love when he wags his tail or does his little exciting bark. It's such a deep bark, but so NOT menacing at all.

* I love that he pops up on my work zoom calls and everyone says ""awwww!""

* I love that he gets to play with his girlfriend (lol) [Rose](https://www.reddit.com/r/PetTheDamnDog/comments/oks0od/my_friends_dog_gets_upset_if_youre_not_petting/)

The best part is that I can continue to foster and volunteer at my local shelter. So we may take in a little buddy for Bone to hang around with soon.

I love... well... everything about Bone! I can't believe it. I am not an emotional person, but when it comes to animals I can get really choked up. Sometimes I'll just watch him nap and almost cry because I cannot believe how content he is.

I know him passing will devastate me, but it's the price to pay for giving and receiving so much love from him. I don't care if it's 2 days or 2 years, I am so happy to have him.

Feel free to chime in!


**[Weapons]**

It seems that a majority of weapons will be made by fusing enemy parts to some kind of base.

Personally, I vastly prefer this to BotW's system. Inventory concerns are no longer a practical issue; with hundreds of Bokoblin horns, you effectively have hundreds of weapons.

Moreover, the modularity means that you can do way more with less. No more being blocked by the need for niche weapons; you can build whatever you need yourself!


**[Verticality]**

No more needing a very limited Revali's Gale or being earthbound due to rain. There are far more options to traversing vertically:

* Ascend ability
* Recall ability used on a falling object
* Flying vehicles
* Fused ""rocket"" contraption (seen in latest trailer)


**[Story]**

Most of the scenes in the latest trailer seem to happen in the present, not the past.

Zelda seems to be a component of the present day story.

Finally, we get a real villain! So excited for this one.


**[Dungeons]**

The latest trailer showed a massive structure emerging out of sand.

Moreover, there is a massive volcanic subterranean area in the trailer that looks like it could house several fire temples.

Finally, the artbook showed two(?) different aesthetically-unique structures, one of which had an elaborate door (boss door?) Another photo showed what was likely the same structure housing a tear.

These already show a lot of promise over Shrines & Divine Beasts, at least aesthetically.

Have in-game actions affect the larger world around you. This is a hack that allows you to invisibly gate new experiences so you don't disappoint open world absolutists with an *obvious* gate.

If your story requires a crazy new boss fight, gate that behind a newly appearing entrance to a cave, a newly appearing sky island, a new dark forest that suddenly sprouted in an open plain (think Typhlo Ruins), a brand new island from a volcanic eruption (think Eventide), etc. Have these events dependent on raw progress so that order doesn't matter.

Linear story cutscenes can be gated the same way. Changes to villages, NPC lives/story arcs, etc. can also be gated like this.

The major downside here? The new cutscenes and content can't reference anything you've done prior, since there's no guarantee on whether you've completed quest X or quest Y by that point. This is a pretty significant downside IMO, but still beats having no progression. However, you can partially alleviate this by keeping all the *local* changes induced by completed content (think clearing the rain in Zora's Domain, etc.)

With 100% non-linearity, you get something like Hyrule Castle where players can just skip obstacles—so developers wouldn't put that much effort into puzzles as many of them will almost certainly be skipped.

Hyrule Castle is a spectacular labyrinth, but not a great Zelda dungeon.

And you don't have to use ""lock and keys"". Difficulty gating and more environmentally-consistent obstacles can work as well.

Don't Divine Beasts fall into this category, you ask? Maybe, but the exploration, atmosphere, and mystery (in terms of new abilities, enemies, etc.) leave a lot to be desired. I think something in between Divine Beasts & Hyrule Castle with fresh atmospheres/mechanics would be heaven.

But I think this characterization is at best incomplete and at worst unfair, for several reasons:

1. Challenges that require power-ups are a staple of gaming, and are present *even within BotW*. While you can theoretically defeat Lynels and climb to the top of the Gerudo Highlands in the beginning of the game, it is nigh impossible to do so without powering up. Indeed, questing after these power-ups is universally considered ""rewarding"" by all camps (I think!) So in conclusion, no one complains about ""difficulty gating"" for obstacles like these.
2. Not all traditional Zelda puzzles are ""obvious square holes"", and quite a few BotW puzzles *are* (point here being that BotW is not immune to this problem.) I was never shocked when I had to use Magnesis on a metal object; it was, with few exceptions, immediately obvious and unimpressive. In those cases, the real mental stimulation came from having to accurately manipulate objects in 3D rather than solve some grand puzzle that crescendoed in a ""Eureka"" moment. *Where BotW shines* is in allowing multiple approaches to many puzzles, but in many cases the ""correct"" answer is obvious and the ""incorrect"" answer is a physics hack rather than some truly novel gameplay. To conclude: ""gated"" puzzles need not insult the player's intelligence any more than the BotW status quo.
3. By demanding that everything encountered be immediately solvable, we completely throw out a very valid form of gameplay: non-local planning (both temporally and spatially non-local.) Puzzles that require an object/tool from another part of the map, or an object/tool that can only be achieved after other tasks are complete, are denigrated as ""immersion breaking"", when in reality they can be *incredibly* immersive if done right. I'll go out and say that just as I find certain puzzle styles condescending, I *also* find forced locality condescending (""forced"" as in ""made a core gameplay theme"".) It makes me feel like the dev thinks I have zero attention span and am too lazy to leave my immediate vicinity to solve a puzzle. In conclusion: If others can call certain puzzle styles ""condescending"", then forced locality is fair game too.
4. This perspective ignores other big hits to immersive exploration that are a consequence of having all items/mechanics at the jump. In the action-adventure genre, the incentive behind exploration is the *discovery of the new*. Another incentive is to see our protagonist become stronger, in ways that are ideally more nuanced than simply increasing our hit power (as an extreme, imagine a game where every weapon plays the same exact way but with different levels of power. Obviously no bueno.) I'd argue that removing discoverable items/mechanics significantly lessens these two incentives. Personally, I would have been *far* more immersed into a brand new region if I knew that it contained new mechanics and new gameplay. Instead, epic backdrops like Faron Jungle and Hebra are disappointingly relegated to being pretty vessels for your 100th Shrine, 300th Korok, etc.

For some context on what *I'd* like to see: I'm not sure why there has to be a dichotomy between ""freedom"" and ""full linearity"". I hope the new game has the same (or different) core Runes handed to you at the outset, but please let us discover new mechanics as the game progresses!

Another example: Kakariko, which is just clinging to life by hiding in the mountains, is a big part of the ""sleepy village in the desolate wilds"" vibe that BotW nailed. This vibe seamlessly established the post-apocalyptic nature of the world without much in the way of explicit reminders.

That being said, I personally didn't experience much sadness over the destruction. Outside of the story surrounding the Champions & Zelda, we don't really see the human impact. The ruins have zero human elements within them, and are really just carbon copied graphical assets that the devs used to fill the game world. There are no original elements to them, let alone human elements like children's toys, notes left behind, discernable structures such as schools, etc.

Without these human elements, it's hard to relate to the human toll of the Great Calamity. It becomes as abstract as the cold letters within a history book.

One notorious example of this that is not unique to SS is a hookshot medallion in the middle of an unoccupied place, such as a desert. Why is this here? What purpose does it serve besides being an artificial reminder from the game devs that ""you have to use a hookshot here""? 

You could argue that this applies to dungeons as well, although dungeons don't depend on believability as much as the overworld. They act more like tests for the hero rather than as a backdrop for the game's lore. That being said, I believe even dungeons could benefit from this thinking. The best dungeons IMO are not arbitrary elemental temples but unique, believable structures like the Sandship or Snowpeak Ruins. Extending that believability to the internal puzzle elements, and making puzzles elements less obvious in general, could lend itself to some much richer gameplay.

This is actually one of the things I quite enjoyed about the Divine Beasts and BotW's overworld. (Someone might argue that the game achieved this by having underwhelming overworld puzzles and recycling Divine Beasts, which is a separate discussion.)

Moreover, motion control combat forced developers to make the design of enemies more ""obvious"" so that players could tell how they needed to swing their Wii remote in combat. This is why Bokoblins have the design that they do, which in my opinion has to be the worst in the series by far.

I'm open to playing with this formula, but making these dungeons big ""open air"" structures (like the labyrinths) removes that magic for me, for two reasons:

1. It makes it possible to access or view parts of the dungeon in any order, which gets rid of a lot of the mystery/suspense that makes Zelda dungeons so atmospheric.


2. The biggest issue with ""open air"" dungeons is that you are constrained to follow the rules of reality.

**Edit:** In hindsight, BotW *does* have a singular theme: a post-apocalyptic world, where tech/civilization has been replaced by nature. Pretty cool theme when you dissect it! However, I wish they did a better job of emphasizing that point with side quests and Easter Eggs that expand on the lore. Could have replaced some of the CTRL+C shrines/ruins with more interesting content IMO.",False,False,truezelda,Does anyone else feel that BotW's world was not memorable,0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/p51prv/does_anyone_else_feel_that_botws_world_was_not/

After deep thought, the issue for me—and I suspect a lot of these same people—is **the lack of world building**.

Why do many enjoy the world of OoT/TP more than the overworld of SS? I think it has a lot to do with what makes the overworld of SS such a joy to many SS fans:

*The overworld is a gigantic dungeon*.

Dungeons are a funny thing in Zelda. We sort of suspend our disbelief the moment we walk into a dungeon, treating the structure as a game mechanic rather than a beacon of realism, i.e. world-building. Most of the times, dungeons make no sense. A room in a volcanic temple whose only purpose is to house a puzzle that magically spawns a chest? A sliding block puzzle inside a Yeti's mansion? Totally nonsensical, unless you suspend your disbelief and realize that this is a part of the game where we get to have *fun*, via puzzles. Realism can wait.

That being said, a convincing world does a lot to add to the ""adventure aesthetic"" that runs deep in the franchise's veins. Despite its emptiness,  Twilight Princess's overworld featured many convincing civilizations and settlements, all with different lore (if thin) and a variety of characters. I'd argue that despite having weaker AIs, the NPCs of pre-BotW games had far more variety than the NPCs of BotW, and it's part of what made Zelda so great. Few other franchises have characters like Kamaro, Beedle, and Malo.

Without world building, you lose some connection to the overworld. Cute as they are, the Kikwi, Mogma, etc. have very little lore or unique side interactions with the player; they were mostly cogs in a linear sequence that, in my opinion, skewed too far to the ""dungeon"" side—which removes the ""believable world"" feeling. I think for this reason and others, the segments of SS felt a bit like paintings in Mario 64: canned adventures that were incredibly fun, but not necessarily part of a coherent whole. If you want to be hyperbolic, the world had more of a ""Disneyland"" vibe than a ""Disney kingdom"" vibe (I wouldn't go this far, but some might.)

Overall, I'm being harsh on SS despite being a big fan. I think some of the puzzles were integrated into the environment well (Lanayru comes to mind) and the game as a whole was awesome! Just wanted to give a different take versus the ""SS is linear, and linearity is bad"" take that is common (apologies for the tongue in cheek there haha.) And there is no objective right or wrong here, as everyone has preferences for what they like out of a Zelda game.

**TL;DR:** Linearity was never a complaint in OoT or TP. SS's issue isn't linearity, but the lack of world building. SS sacrificed a living, breathing overworld with interesting NPCs to make the entire game a dungeon, but since dungeons violate realism the game lacked a believable ""adventure aesthetic"" that other Zelda games possessed.",False,False,truezelda,Linearity isn't the issue with the SS overworld,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/p3duzv/linearity_isnt_the_issue_with_the_ss_overworld/

From the issuers' point of view, it is not an easy decision. They not only have a fiduciary duty to protect the best interests of investors, but also incentives to make decisions that maximize executives' gains (stock-based compensation packages).

We are however in a bear market, and despite some upward movements, GME can be pulled down by the gravitational force of a general market correction. If the price is dropping by forces bigger than expected, would it make more sense to wait for the downward trend to reverse or at least decelerate?   While the stock price follows a downward market trend, an announcement may be considered ill-timed, and may not reflect the best interests of the actors involved. Under this logic, they will wait a bit to see how things play out.

One Superstonker could say, ""it makes sense to announce this soon, before a stronger price drop, so that any positive impact on the price takes place before the price touches a lower bottom"". But this would be more of a selling / short-term investing argument, in which the objective is similar to a pumping before dumping strategy.

I think the logic of the GME board and most Superstonkers is oriented towards not selling (HODLING) and making this a longer-term strategy (DRSing, infinity-pooling, etc.). If this is the prevalent orientation, it makes sense to speculate that they may have incentives to announce during more favorable market conditions, when there is less uncertainty about a diversity of adverse factors that could mess with this very important decision.

How do you see this? When would the announcement make most sense?

This is however a weak argument because the real cause is not the buyer but the short-seller, and if one whale chooses not to do it, another one might. Also, if the catastrophe is imminent, taking part in the MOASS can be a lifesaver.
* There is an implicit threat to anyone in the financial world who dares to play against the big boys. This is likely, actually, as big finance is all about connections after all. However, this shouldn't stop disconnected whales from foreign countries or new risk-loving funds with capital and no reputation to lose.

What do you think? Why don't we see big whales jumping on board? Or do you think they are actually here but somehow their presence and impact is unnoticeable?

Because this research objective would be a disgrace for science, and any human being with one drop of brains and decency would use their skills for much much better. But more fundamentally, your hypothesis would be flawed. Let me explain, as apparently you have been unable to understand.

We can see you from far, far away:

* Your strategy is to manipulate two factors: drop the price first, then maintain it.
* And you waited.

Listen, we are self-regarding investors, who have individually chosen to learn more and be informed about this stock (and we like it), and for a year or so we have rationally decided to buy, hodl, and register. It get's better: we are different types of players: we have a diversity of demographics, values, financial literacy, and economic motivations. And yet, we all draw the exact same conclusion: our strategy makes sense.

Yes, this is what both you and us call a DOMINANT STRATEGY. That's the equilibrium baby; there's no equillibria here my friends.

So your strategy was costly and did not work. Did you kill our motivation? Nope, look at how active we are posting and upvoting. Furthermore, look at the atmosphere: we want this, we have fun while we wait, and you are a stupid meme. For reals: your behavioral science is a joke.

Do not call yourselves scientists. Remove that from your office desk and door. You are a disgrace, and embarrassment, both in terms of enlightenment and skill. You are ineffective, and your supervisors should dispose of you.

By the way, do not dare to return to academia. If you do, hide your prior experience, it's embarrassing to say the least.

With big numbers at play (627k subscribers + possibly a significant number of unregistered readers), manipulating *when* a fraction of investors buys stock might allow SHFs to gain some control over the buying pressure. 

\* \* \* 

Sporadically (or so it seems), identifiable characters appear in the main stream media, and give incendiary statements. Some questions arise:

* Why are the messages so unambiguously provoking? Think of ""sell the stock now, ask questions later"", ""We understand short interest better than you"", and today's nonsensical chain of ""you are the bad guys""-themed tweets. 
* Who would benefit from this strategy and how would those benefits materialize?

Let's assume that individual investors independently see value and therefore follow the \[BHSR strategy\]:  buy-hold-shop-register. Let's also assume that the investors, with a few exemptions, have a limited buying capacity, which is rather exhausted *at the present*, and depends on upcoming bi-weekly or monthly (new) income. 

If investors plan to use their **future** new income to buy *N* shares several days from now, SHFs can reduce this future number *N* by triggering impulsive buying **now**. If retail investors have a fixed budget to buy GME, manipulating them to buy at certain moments spreads their individual buying pressure across time. This can even create risks for investors, especially when little or no disposable cash is left (reducing the expected value of the next purchase of shares). 

So let's say now that SHFs have these teams of behavioral scientists, data analysts, and media experts (because they do), and use them to design advantageous strategies. One strategy could be as follows:

* Ask a recognizable character to say something obviously antagonistic, provocative. 
* Make sure that the character is heard and the message is clear (maybe make numerous posts about it?). 
* Amplify the message by making triggered reactions more visible (e.g., awards and upvoting for furious stands and angry titles).  
* Count the instances in which small numbers of shares were bought during that day, and measure the effect of the manipulation on individual investors' buying behavior. 
* Use this estimate to plan ahead when it is more convenient to trigger anger-based impulsive buying (depending on some cash flow or liabilities cycles, before a so-called short ladder attack, etc.). 
* Bonus 1: use this strategy to distract the forum from other possibly relevant topics (regulatory changes, public communications by authorities, ComputerShare education, etc.)
* Bonus 2: use this strategy to register investors' angry reactions, which can be used in the media (perhaps even in trial?) to claim that investors have a destructive, vindictive, anarchist, anti-capitalist, or who-knows-what no-no agenda (and are therefore dangerous for the stability of the markets or whatever).

\* \* \*

What can the forum do? One option is to continue enjoying the show that they put (by posting, commenting, laughing at it), question whether there is any chance that this show serves an agenda, avoid giving it an unnecessary amount of attention (laugh and dismiss), and question whether it is triggering impulsive behaviors.

TA;DR: Part (not all) of the stock price can be explained by cycles or repeated patterns. If we take cycles of 30 trading days (as opposed to 16,17, ..., 33, or 34 days), the identified cycles capture the largest fluctuations (differences between highest and lowest close prices). Periods of 30 trading days reveal the most extreme cyclical fluctuations. 

\* \* \*

It is known that [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/), u/broccaaa, and many others have explored T+N hypotheses in detail, and have revived and dismissed these hypotheses as new findings come along (this is the way). I wondered if there was any DD using decomposition (explained below), and my search yielded null results. So perhaps this could be something valuable to explore.  

The idea is simple. A time series can be decomposed into (i) trend, (ii) seasonal (cyclical or repeated), and (iii) residual (sometimes called random) components ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_of_time_series)). This means that we can extract the seasonal component of any GME price series. 

**Method**

I downloaded the historical price data from Yahoo Finance (although one should question what they report, as revealed recently). The selected time frame is YTD, which starts on 2021-01-04. Following the work of u/broccaaa, the analysis focuses on the close price (but others may explore high, low, and open). 

When declaring the daily close price as a time series, it is possible to define its frequency (the number of observations per unit of time, such as weekly, quarterly, etc.). Given that the decomposition takes this frequency into account, the strategy was designed as follows:

1. Declare the series with frequency = 16. 
2. Decompose the series (additive). 
3. Measure the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values of the seasonal component).
4. Estimate the accuracy of the decomposition. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean squared error (RMSE) are used in this case. 
5. Record the range and accuracy, and repeat (got to Step 1) for the next day.

This procedure is repeated starting at T+16 and ending at T+34. 

The range of the seasonal component (point 3) captures the extent to which the cycle is more extreme. Of course, there are other ways to measure the magnitude of the cycles, but the range can provide  interesting insights. As compared to a T+N that makes the seasonal component more flat, a T+N that amplifies the differences between the highest and lowest values may better capture the cycles that we think we are observing. (For more advanced apes: it may be interesting to replicate this using SDs or any other variance indicators for the seasonal component.) 

It is also important to form an idea of the accuracy of each decomposition. It is possible that the range is increasing at the expense of accuracy, which would make the analysis less meaningful. The central question is then the following:

Which *N* in T+*N* leads to the largest range of the seasonal component, without compromising the accuracy of the decomposition too much?

**Results**

The figure above shows the range (maximum minus minimum values) of the seasonal component (blue line) starting at T+16 and ending at T+34 (left Y-axis). It also shows the mean absolute error (MAE), which is the average of the absolute value of the residuals (right Y-axis). 

T+30 leads to the highest range with a level of accuracy that is comparable to the ""best"" accuracy levels of the other decompositions. [u/JuanDelAlto](https://www.reddit.com/user/JuanDelAlto/), maybe [you were onto something here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxw3xs/there_is_t21_and_t35anybody_looked_at_the_30/).

The figure below contains the decomposition for T+30. ""Observed"" is the series of the daily close price. ""Trend"" captures the direction in which the series is moving, after removing the seasonal component, and the residual (which is labeled at the bottom as ""random""). ""Seasonal"" captures those repeated patterns we have been talking about. The analysis estimates the range, which is the difference between the highest and lowest values of these component. ""Random"" is the residual of what you get when you remove the trend and seasonal components from the observed series. Ideally, this component should approach zero as much as possible. OK, you many now know why ""additive"" is on the title ;-)

**Discussion**

This analysis explores which day *N* in the T+*N* hypotheses leads to the largest seasonal component range. T+30 is clearly identified as the winner candidate. 

The analysis can be improved in many ways. For example, this can be done for the ""meme"" stock bundle that [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/) and u/broccaaa have mentioned. If the ranges of these cycles tend to be larger at t+30 for other stocks, this may further support the existence of larger-than-GME cycles. 

The analysis also has limitations. This is based on a very basic decomposition. Others may explore more advanced ways to decompose this series. Furthermore, the range may not be the best indicator for the relevance of the cyclical component, and standard deviations, total sums, or other metrics may be considered to be more appropriate. 

**Final notes**

If you followed through all this, you may want to know about actual dates. For example, when are the highest and lowest values of the cycle taking place? If these findings can be exploited for day-trading, I would rather not get into that level of detail. By the way, day traders: you are rationally-bounded, short-sided players, and you are completely missing the point of the game (do better, think about the larger reward).

The only result they may be getting from their analyses is that apes' strategy does not vary, and this possibly feeds their Fear.

**""Know your enemy""**

[Here's Kenny talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KOT0_I4Fvw) about big data, quants, and data science. He explains how ""many dynamics of how humans behave can be in a sense taken advantage of by technology"". It is therefore likely that part of the SHFs' strategy is to analyze what apes post to identify potential vulnerabilities and manipulate apes' buying & holding behavior. 

**Dear SHFs: you cannot ""know your enemy""** 

Go ahead, analyze apes' posts. You will see that there is not such thing as an ape profile or well-defined set of profiles (besides the rather obvious *lurker*, *DD wrinkle brains*, *professional meme-er*, *etc*). Run advanced machine learning algorithms and sophisticated cluster analyses. Try your best to explain or predict sentiment and motivational postures. You will only find support for great diversity. 

How can you know your enemy when some apes are making Mayo memes while others get angry about and fight against those who make Mayo memes? Listen, apes have their own soap operas running 24/7 (with special episodes during the weekends). Apes act like young lovers who sometimes fight, reconcile, learn from their mistakes, and then experiment shoving things wherever they want.  How do you expect your researchers and data analysts to make sense of apes, when apes don't even understand themselves?  

One key point: when predicting or explaining a certain outcome, the analysis requires the outcome to vary. Now [look at the OBV: apes are not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwphtu/dont_worry_the_price_isnt_real_look_at_the_obv_it/). Let's put it a different way: your outcome variable is not varying: apes only buy and hold. If anything, you could try to predict when apes buy to a larger or lesser extent, but it's all the same: apes buy and buy and do not sell.

**The beauty of some tweet ambiguity** 

Apes follow the tweets of people they like, and they know you follow those tweets too ;-) Here's the beautiful thing about those tweets: apes have no idea what they mean. No clue. Apes love to speculate, though. No one can infer with certainty anything about those tweets, but apes sincerely enjoy contemplating the infinity of possible interpretations. 

This generates uncertainty and doubt... for you. The more apes speculate, the more they post about possible interpretations, the more noise your analyses incorporate. Apes have no stable, linear way of behaving or expressing themselves: apes are the birds that [John Nash is unable to model from his window in a Beautiful Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voqjl5yDsyk). 

**Dear SHF behavioral scientists and data analysts** 

Apes' chaotic behavior is fascinating to analyze but not from your angle. Are you aiming at killing their motivation through boredom, ladder-attacks during hyped dates, and a variety of dispersed FUD attacks? Are you planning a fun move for this weekend, while you monitor apes' reactions with your bright office lights on? Apes are determined, and enjoy detecting and mocking FUD. Their memes are creative, surprising, and unpredictable. Your analyses will increasingly incorporate noise and dispersion, and your insights will only lead to speculation and new questions. 

As you examine apes, your analytical uncertainty might grow, your insights are likely permeated by doubt, and chances are that that all this leads to a nice little emotion labeled as fear. By looking at apes, you feed your own FUD.

The primary targets may be (i) potential retail investors, (ii) the international media outlets, and (iii) government agencies and policy-makers. TL;DR below.

**1. The opponents' FUD strategy.** FUD refers to fear, uncertainty, and doubt aimed at maximizing our opponents' net benefits. Enlightening posts have already elaborated on the opponents' strategies (e.g., u/ayyyybro's [running list of examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnjqpw/dont_forget_what_they_did_a_running_list_of_fud/); u/akichi08's [playbook of moves](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndzxgs/in_the_wake_of_the_massive_amount_of_fud_rolling/)). In the recent AMA, [Wes Christian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rJujnpKiqM) explicitly confirmed that several manipulation strategies are indeed well-documented and pervasive.

**2. Two types of FUD.** *External* FUD refers to FUD planted in media outlets and other social media. A clear example relates to how the main media outlets block positive news about GameStop, and predominantly report negative news from biased or selective angles.  *Internal* FUD refers to FUD planted inside this community through posts, comments, upvoting or downvoting, and giving awards. A recent example of internal FUD relates to [Glacier Capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nf7lh4/the_four_hoursemen_of_glacier_capital/). External FUD could be posted in Superstonk, but apes' stubborn opposable thumbs would either mock it or downvote it.

**3. Who's the primary target of external FUD?**

3.1 Potential retail investors. External FUD scares away potential (non-ape / non-redditor) investors. This helps mitigate the propagation of the diamond-hands buy-hold strategy, and contain the growth of the ape population.

3.2 International media outlets. Non-US outlets are less likely to cite US primary sources, and are more likely to reproduce the external FUD that is published in the mainstream US media outlets. This helps propagate an international narrative about the GameStop story (e.g., anarchist redditors bad, ""gamification"" of retail investment bad, some possible regulations bad). This also helps safeguard the opponents' reputation abroad.

3.3. Government agencies and policy-makers. External FUD helps reinforce the views of many representatives that do not have the time, interest or patience to learn or understand the style, format, or terminology of this subreddit, its posts, and comments. They are less likely to get information away from this community and are more likely targeted (and to some extent manipulated)  by the external FUD sources. This helps reinforce the narrative of who are the good and the bad, which regulations may be required, who should be punished or absolved, etc.

**4. Who's the primary target of internal FUD?**

**This may be counter-intuitive**. We, the active and passive members of this community, may not be the primary target of internal FUD. At first sight, one may think ""oh, they are trying to reduce the likelihood of buying-holding (a diamond-hands strategy), and trying to increase the chances of selling now or paperhanding later"". This can be partially true, but at this point, they must have confirmed over and over again (after variety of strong attacks) that our [strategy is dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance). Two things: we are determined, and we are patient. So who are the targets?

The targets of internal FUD are also the potential retail investors, international media outlets, and government officials. Internal FUD makes us look as a group of individuals who are overly-focused on moderators' drama, or who overly-speculate about the existence of a fund or about some hidden symbols and enigmas in certain tweets and websites... Internal FUD starts or reinforces these elements, and makes this community resemble other communities with less popular (radical) stands on the curvature of the earth, the benefits of vaccines, or the idolization of political figures. **Internal FUD does not affect apes.** Instead, internal FUD may prevent non-apes from harvesting the rich DD that so many wrinkled apes produce on a daily basis, may prevent international media outlets from citing this forum as a reliable source, and may portray us under a less favorable light to government officials.

Now, don't get me wrong. I love the chaos that surrounds the dominant buy-hold-vote strategy, and I love every minute I spend in this subreddit. This is honestly the most fun I have had for a prolonged time in a long while. I am not advocating in favor of changing anything in this community. This is simply one perspective on how all the FUD that we detect and mock may be actually targeted elsewhere.

**TL;DR:** Apes' buy-hold-vote strategy is dominant and not affected by FUD. FUD is likely targeted at other actors to prevent propagation, safeguard an international reputation, and create a narrative for regulators.",False,False,Superstonk,Think about it: We are not the primary target of FUD,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngd5p4/think_about_it_we_are_not_the_primary_target_of/

I recently upgraded a bunch of parts, including my CPU (from Intel 6400 to 6700K) and a stick of RAM. PC was running well with CPU overclocked to 4.6GHz using the built in ""CPU upgrade"" option in the Gigabyte bios. Suddenly I encountered a BSOD while playing a game and now it won't boot. It just cycles on and off before even reaching the BIOS.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Since my RAM has mismatched timings, I tried every combination in all possible slots but no luck. I also tried clearing CMOS and replacing the mobo battery. Finally I switched back to my 6400 and it started working again. Still won't boot with the 6700K though.

I've been playing the deck a lot over the past year so I thought I'd share my current version of the deck.  

Decklist  
https://lor.mobalytics.gg/decks/bvnehq071lkl2svcmfa0

General info  
By no means is this a good deck: it loses to faster strategies and folds to itself quite often.   
The combo requires drawing both Smooth Soloist and Chief Mechanist Zevi.  
While difficult, it's crazy fun when you're able to pull it off.  
For those who don't know how the combo works, you proc Smooth Soloist to get Veteran Investigators to 0 mana.  
Use Counterfeit Copies to shuffle 0-cost Investigators in your deck and mill your opponent to death.  
Zevi is the most important card when comboing, it creates additional Investigators to smooth out your draws.  
Here's a video of the combo going off:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfRuneterra/comments/khgr05/longest_otk_of_my_life_14min_sped_up_to_4x_went/  

Card additions  
Parrlay is a Soloist activator that can clear early threats.  
Eager apprentice is a better Coral Creatures that generates more mana without clogging up your hand.  
Tahm Kench is a lot of stats on 4, discard fodder generator and removal bait.  

Tips  
It's important to know that to reliably mill your opponent you need 2 Soloist procs.   
Otherwise your hand will get clogged with cards you're unable to play.  
Only go for the combo with a single Soloist proc if you have a lot of mana (ex. you were able to play a Zevi in a previous turn)  
and if your deck is about the same size as your opponent's (meaning you don't need to use Counterfeit copies on Counterfeit copies).  
Mulligan for Smooth Soloist against most decks, keeping 2 if possible.  
Also look for Ballistic bot, it helps you churn through your deck with Zaunite Urchin, Sump Dredger and Rummage.  
Take as many passes as you can and drop Soloist on 7.  
Play Zevi when your opponent is tapped out for removal and combo for the win.  
It's a really fun deck and I recommend combo fans to try it out.

Why play this deck? Zephrys put Reno decks over the top this expansion, and Shudderwock trumps other Reno decks due to its inevitability.

**Gameplan**  
You need to get a cost reduction on either Murmuring Elemental or Shudderwock so you can play both on the same turn.  
Play both cards after having played both Dopplegangster and Grumble earlier in the game to get infinite Shudderwocks.  
Some fancy plays are to alternate between Shudderwock and Grumble if Grumble survives, or to draw into Grumble through Sandbinder/Jepetto's battlecry.  
Avoid using Zephrys until absolutely necessary since it complicates the combo: you'll need additional hand space when you go off.  

**Tech choices**  
I ran both Eater of Secrets and Kezan Mystic to have a decent chance against secret mage.  
If secret mage wasn't so strong, they'd be replaced with MC Tech and Brrloc.  
Sandbinder, Storm Chaser, and Curator provide extra card draw.  

**Notable exclusions**  
Quest: Some matchups depend on drawing a single card (ex. Volcano for odd rogue), and the quest reward isn't worth losing a card in your opening hand.  
Earthquake: It's too slow, you'll often want to clear the board and play a combo piece (Dopplegangster or Grumble) on the same turn. It also makes Storm Chaser less reliable.  
Sandstorm Elemental: It's a decent card but I didn't want to include too many elementals to increase the odds of getting Zephrys or a combo piece  from Sandbinder.  
Hagatha: Hand size can be a problem. Primordial Drake accomplishes the same thing.

**Mulligan tips**  
Always keep Hagatha's Scheme.  
Against aggro, keep Finley, Zephrys, Doomsayer, Storm Chaser, Reno, and board clears. 

**Matchups**  
Secret mage: About even. Look for Reno, Zephrys and secret tech.  
Reno decks: As long as you can survive their Dirty Rat, you should be favored. Try to play combo pieces asap to avoid getting them ratted. You may want to hold on to useless minions.  
Big priest: Highly favored. Keep transform effects. Plague of Murlocs destroys them.   
Rogue, Shaman, Paladin, Warrior, Druid: Mulligan as if they're aggro. Against Druid keep Skulking Geist.",False,False,wildhearthstone,Legend with Reno Shudderwock 2,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildhearthstone/comments/cw8h17/legend_with_reno_shudderwock_2/

Hi everyone, I just wanted to share the deck I played to legend. It's my first time hitting legend with a deck I (kinda) made myself. 

Shudderwock is a great deck if you want to beat control. Why Reno? I realized that you don't need a second copy of most cards in Shudderwock. Reno is also much better than a second healing rain.  

About the combo  
Try to get a cost reduction on Murmuring Elemental/Shudderwock or keep the coin going second. The goal is to play Murmuring Elemental and Shudderwock after having played Dopplegangster and Grumble. If you manage to get Grumble to stick, you can play Shudderwock by itself and alternate between Shudderwock and Grumble.

Mulligan tips  
Always keep  
* Ice fishing  
* Hagatha's scheme  

Against aggro keep  
* Beakered lightning  
* Finley  
* Devolve  
* Doomsayer  
* Maelstrom portal  
* Storm chaser/Volcano  
* Reno  

Matchup tips  
Big priest: Relatively easy. Mulligan for Devolve and Hex and keep Loatheb.  
Quest mage: Bad matchup. Look for Dirty Rat, keep Loatheb. Play cards as fast as possible to avoid overdrawing.  
Hunter, Druid, Paladin, Rogue, Shaman, and Warrior: Mulligan as if aggro.  
Darkest hour warlock: Keep Hagatha's Scheme, mulligan for Murmuring Elemental and MCTech.  

I'm still looking to improve the deck if possible, so please feel free to give advice.

I've been working within the Salesforce ecosystem for the past 5 years and while i wouldn't be the best admin out there, i do have some certs and feel somewhat comfortable working in the environment. My main mental hurdle though is my non-formal education (a degree) which gives me a lack of confidence at times. 

I've recently been given an opportunity however to train (apprentice even?) with MS Dynamics Business Central for ~12 months while getting paid, with the likelihood of getting kept on for a full time position also.

Is this something that you would jump at given the opportunity? I'm not too familiar with Dynamics, and i suppose with having worked within Salesforce for such a long time the one thing i've been wanting to do is develop as a pure programmer (currently doing the [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) course)

Indigo Traveller recently [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydnnRyPPLs4) documenting a trip to a refugee camp in South Sudan. Worth a watch if you get a chance. In it he shows how there’s a flooded area of land being kept back by levees which are susceptible to breaking by bad actors. This unfortunately will overflow a nearby refugee camp.

I can’t recall exactly why, but for whatever reason this refugee camp was built just on the other side of this levee which houses +100 thousand people currently. People whose main source of income seems to be burning wood and selling the charcoal for ~$8 a day.

It’s a pretty tough watch to be honest. Dirty water, no sanitation/plumbing system, no food source from what I could tell, little prospects, and snakes within the flooded area where people have to travel through. Its admirable that you see people smiling at all within the video. 

The whole time I was watching this I couldn’t help but think what an immense impact sharing permaculture principles and ideas would have for these people. 

[Geoff Lawton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITph5GJoKbA&list=PL321kfqP1fZnWTPPpqZUN9ntP2-rjIP39&index=33)  has a wonderful series where he’s documenting the reclaiming of desert land into farmable land. Its not exactly a fast process, but 10 years can go by quickly in the rear view mirror.

[Andrew Millison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY8ds4BiG1A&list=PPSV) recently even posted a video illustrating the impact that trees and forests have on regulating rain and ground water in their environments. Seems like a simple enough method to contain the flood, while also ensuring that the water isn’t lost in a drought prone part of the world. I’m sure there’d be additional benefits from planting them. Shade from the hot sun even.

Am I being naive here? Too idealistic maybe?

If I’m living in a house full of glass shards, I’m unable to clear the glass out and I cut myself from it repeatedly, no doubt medical aid should be provided. But in the long term, shouldn’t I be helped to remove the broken glass from my home? To make the home more hospitable?

&#x200B;

I have data that e.g. a flyer was given to 1000 people, and 10 people scanned a code - on a particular day at a particular location. The number of flyers handed out on a day varies.

&#x200B;

My aim is to create a predictive model: if we hand out flyers on X day at Y locaiton in X industry, how many will convert/what will be the conversion rate? (Convert in this case is buying a product, scanning a 2D barcode, visiting a URL, etc)

&#x200B;

I can think of 2 ways to model this

&#x200B;

1. make a regression model where one of the independent variables is the total number of flyers handed out, and the dependent variable is the total number of conversions. This number is typically between 0 and 100.

2. make a regression model to predict the conversion \*rate\*, that is, a number between 0 and 1.

&#x200B;

My conversion rate and conversions are both very skewed when I plot them on a histogram. E.g. 30% of the time, a marketing campaign has 0 conversions. Then 1 is the next commonest count, then 2, etc...

&#x200B;

For this reason I am sure vanilla logistic regression and many other models will not work very well.

&#x200B;

I am considering one idea being a 2-level model: a binary classifier to classify into zero and non-zero, then a separate classifier trained on a log scale.

&#x200B;

I am wondering also if the conversions can be modelled as a Poisson process because the curve looks like that. But is there a kind of predictive model that can do that?

`guiltyFirearmsAct1968(Person) :- has(Person, Time, firearm), committedSchedule1Offence(Person, Time). guiltyFirearmsAct1968(Person) :- has(Person, Time, imitationFirearm), committedSchedule1Offence(Person, Time).`

`has(Jim, Yesterday, firearm).`

`committedSchedule1Offence(Jim, Yesterday).`

`guiltyFirearmsAct1968(Jim)?`

and I get the answer

`Unable to process query. Please restate.`

I am using Calysto Prolog if that makes a difference? I'm new to Prolog so this might be a rookie mistake. I wasn't sure if Jim and Yesterday should be all lowercase, but that doesn't seem to work either. I would be grateful for any pointers.

Initially I have data about individuals' employment state in 2016 and demographics (gender, social class, region, education level).

I have information on all government interventions (career coaching, etc) from 2016 to 2021.

And finally I have the data about individuals' employment state in 2021.

My task is to understand how the interventions affect outcomes, and how the social class affects the outcome, and whether interventions could be better targeted. However, the interventions are not randomly assigned - people with more deprived backgrounds are more likely to receive an intervention for example.

I am wondering if I can use a Bayesian network to model this? So the state in 2021 is caused by the state in 2016 and the interventions received.

\`P(employment state in 2021 | interventions received, employment state in 2016)\`

The other option I am looking into is the machine learning approach: make a machine learning model to predict state given interventions and employment. (e.g. random forest)

The third approach I guess is the statistical approach: linear model of number of interventions and demographic to predict the state, and get significance levels for the different parameters. However this may not work because the relationships are highly non-linear. Interventions may have a positive effect for some demographics and regions and negative effect for others.

I am especially interested in the Bayesian approach. Has anybody done something similar and how would you advise to go about it?

I would like to develop a gold standard for evaluating my search engine, so that when I make an improvement I can score it.

One way is to get lots of human guinea pigs to manually annotate and score lots of rankings.

I'd appreciate some pointers towards which algorithm is currently the best/state of the art to use?

As part of a page I'm building in Wordpress (hosted by me) I would like to add a form with some dropdown combo boxes, with the following interactive behaviour:

* first there's just one combo box. As soon as the user selects an option, some text is appended to the form and a new combo box appears asking the next question
* there might be up to about 5 questions but the total number of questions varies
* the number of options in each combo box depends on the answer the user selected to the previous questions
* all fields are combo boxes, i.e. there's no free text input.
* when the user has answered all questions the answer is displayed.

The page would be similar to this: http://www.thistothat.com/
except it would have multiple questions not just 2 combos.

Please can somebody recommend the best way to do this? I have programming knowledge but not PHP or Javascript, ideally I don't want to have to learn a new language just to do this task.

I have no requirement as to whether this combo stuff should be managed on browser or server side, whatever's easiest.

If there's a plugin or library that would be great. Is Wordpress a help or hindrance with this?

I have worked with convolutional neural networks and believe I could explain relatively succinctly what they do and what they're good for. I would like to gain a similar basic understanding of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Maybe someone with hands on experience in the field can provide an explanation.

# Analogy: basic explanation of convolutional neural networks

For example, here's my explanation of what convolutional neural networks do:

You want to classify an image into cat or dog. A convolutional neural network takes the pixel values and repeatedly multiplies them by some parameters and does other operations on them and then outputs two values like [0, 1] or [0.98, 0.02] indicating the probabilities of being a cat or a dog.

Where do the parameters for this model come from?
You can obtain the parameters by setting them to random initial values, taking a training set of cat and dog images, passing them through the network, and repeatedly improving the parameters until the cat images' outputs are as close as possible to [1, 0] and the dog images give an output as close as possible to [0, 1].

How do you know what changes to make to the parameters to improve the model? You calculate a number called the loss function. The loss function says how far the cat and dog images' respective outputs are from where they should be. The neural network training process repeatedly adjusts the parameters in order to reduce the loss function and make the network output closer to its correct values for the training images. If the network is designed well this generalises to cat and dog images that haven't been seen in training.

# Equivalent for MCMC???

I am studying Markov Chain Monte Carlo and would like to arrive at a similarly simple explanation. So I'd like to know what kind of simple but real world application they're good for, what they do, how they work, how they are trained, etc.

I can find some explanations online and in textbooks but they are very theoretical. 

So what would be the simplest possible use case that would actually occur in the real world, analogous to my cat/dog classification example? And how would you go about running MCMC? Can I do it in Excel? Python? Java? Do I need software libraries or can I do it myself? I would like a ""like I'm five"" explanation if you will but assuming I already am familiar with programming and the basic concepts of machine learning such as linear regression etc.

I guess one thing you would use would be to understand weather patterns? But how? What information is it giving you? What data does it receive and what information do you expect MCMC to give you in return? What is MCMC doing that other techniques can't?

I am fine tuning GoogLeNet for a face classification task using Caffe.

I have found that of my fine tuned network's 3 outputs, the 1st and 2nd (the auxiliary classifiers) do better than the final classifier:

layer|error rate
:---|---:
loss1/classifier|7.5%
loss2/classifier|7.7%
loss3/classifier|10.5%

I followed the steps on the Flickr Style tutorial and renamed all 3 classification layers so they were reinitialised. Also I boosted their LR by 10x.

I am using my fine tuned model to calculate the distance between two faces by using the Euclidean distance between the output vectors.

Has anyone else fine tuned GoogLeNet for their own purpose? How did you set the learning rates?

I am developing some applications using a convolutional neural network that I trained, which uses the architecture of GoogLeNet in Caffe. I would like to run them on mobile platforms. Input image size is 256x256.

I would like to know, has anyone tried to run GoogLeNet on mobile platforms? Any tips on how to speed things up? In particular I am looking at Android at the moment but will also look at iPhone soon. Maybe there’s an alternative architecture to GoogLeNet that’s even faster? I am open to any new ideas!

The photos can be any size, and the logo could be varying sizes and also distorted (imagine if the logo is on a surface at an angle, or on the side of a curved bottle).
I am thinking that maybe this could be handled with neural networks. I've followed some of Andrew Ng's lecture notes and they sound very powerful, however I am struggling to understand how NNs can handle the target image located in a different part of the main image, or distorted in some way.

It's easy for me to understand if the input image and the image you're trying to recognise are the same size: every pixel maps to a weight, over several layers, that eventually lead to a similarity metric between two images.
However how can this approach cope with the translations and resizings that I mentioned?

I'm looking at a Java library called Neuroph, which sounds interesting. Basically I'd like to hear from anyone who solved a similar problem before, what ML approach you would recommend. I've also collected some sample photos with logos in photos of varying quality which I could use as training data. However I'm unsure what to do next.

Also if neural networks really are the best or most practical way of solving this? For example, are they slow or do they use a lot of memory? What about a cascade classifier?

1. Performance 2. Battery life 3. Build quality 4. Weight 5. Form factor

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
I intend to photoshop, do some video editing, and maybe a tiny bit of minecraft or something on the side. I have a different PC for gaming, but I do want at least 8GB of RAM as that's what my school has as a baseline.

Eu sou Engenheiro Mecânico e moro no interior da Bahia (umas 9h da capital do ES), me formei em Agosto numa federal em MG e desde então tenho travado uma luta com o mercado de trabalho. Tenho um currículo razoável pra Entry-level (estágio de um ano, intercâmbio e algumas atividades extracurriculares), participei de vários processos de trainee nesse semestre e algumas vagas pra consultorias estratégicas mas levei bota em tudo.

O processo tem sido tenso pra mim, é uma jornada pra chegar em São Paulo (24h de ônibus ou tarifas loucas de avião) e eu só tenho passado pra fases presenciais lá, mesmo usando um endereço de Belo Horizonte (de uma amiga) no CV e nos sites de emprego, inclusive já precisei deixar de lado algumas fases porque não conseguiria chegar em São Paulo em tempo hábil.

Eu juntei um pouco de dinheiro fazendo freela na graduação + estágio (uns 8k) pra viajar quando formasse, só que agora estou pensando em usar essa grana pra procurar emprego em São Paulo (ou outro lugar, talvez).

A idéia de colocar a cara no mundo e torrar essa grana me assusta muito, eu sempre me mudei com coisas certas pra fazer (intercâmbio, estágio e faculdade).

Meus pais querem muito que eu estude pra fazer concurso (meu irmão fez isso e se deu muito bem) mas não acho que seja pra mim e que o momento seja ideal (né tio guedes).

Tenho andando um pouco deprimido por ficar em casa mandando CVs o dia inteiro e sem ser produtivo, a maioria dos meus amigos conseguiu algum tipo de trabalho ou estão pra entrar no mestrado.

Vocês acham loucura? Conhecem alguém que fez isso e deu certo? Preciso de uma luz.

Hello, I’m currently an incoming MS student in Statistics in the US. My program is a terminal 2 years MS program in Statistics. I have the option to go to industry, and work in data science, or pursue a PhD in Statistics.

I find myself utterly cluttered and confused and constantly thinking about this everyday, and it has consumed my mind even after getting into a MS program. Every day, something new changes, where one day I feel like I want to pursue a PhD, but then, I get this hold back, because I think about living on a stipend for 5 more years. And then I suddenly want to do an MS and work.

 But then, I think about how my MS may not be valuable after 20 years, and how my MS isn’t from a well known school and how the PhD is only 5 years and could add more value to my goals ( I wish to work as a quant in finance). 

But also, I think about how, if I had my dream job lined up after my MS, the PhD wouldn’t be something I’d consider.

But then, I think about how my career is really long, and how a PhD may be worth it in the long run. How id regret not even trying.

But then, I think about how maybe I’ll be an ABD in a PhD program and would have wasted my entire 20s doing something I shouldn’t have, because I wasn’t prepared. 



I have constantly had these ping ponging thoughts throughout my head, and I’m not quite sure what I want. 

In one scenario I wish to just get my MS, as then land my dream job and never worry about a PhD ever again.

But then in another scenario I start thinking about how I’ll miss the ability to get deeper into a subject and contribute to the subject I really enjoyed.

Two people had similar backgrounds to me (BS statistics). They ended up talking about how they progressed at the company starting out, the overall tasks they had, and what they were doing now as they have progressed. Both graduated school in 2015.

Both of them talked about their entry level data science job, as follows:

“Panelist 2 and I were both hired here at the consulting firm, and at the time another consultant was starting a “AI Transformative Technologies lab” that was just in its infancy. As fresh graduates, with out backgrounds we got by far our dream job. Panelist 2 and I were basically, from 8-5 everyday, were printing out stacks of deep learning papers, and building industry specific case studies for deep learning. In consulting, you often have many different clients for different industries, so we spent just everyday, building out a portfolio of case studies where we applied SOTA deep learning models, and pitched them to clients in each industry. Overall a dream job where we combined deep learning research with client facing presentations”.

All in all, sounded like a dream job to me. Both of them worked 9 years, doing this, and then when I talked to them after, they both mentioned how they were now heading back to academia to do a PhD in statistics and the other a PhD in CS. At 31 years old, they are leaving this job, because they had moved up to a management level, and wanted to get back into deep learning again, and felt that academia and doing a PhD was where they felt they could succeed. 

I tell this story because sometimes I’ve thought about this. I have an MS, but I know after a few years I’m gonna miss the theoretical stuff I did in my MS, and will probably considering doing a PhD just for that. But something about that doesn’t seem right. It feels that my motivation to go back to do a PhD is to “learn more advanced stats” so I can get away from managerial positions. Cause truthfully, I just don’t really care about managing people, owning a product, or any of the corporate political BS that comes with moving up in a company.

I am talkative with friends, but not so much people I work with. 

I think the best way to describe my personality is an academic, but doesn’t like academia, and who wants to be industry. 

I am an academic at heart and am curious and love the “geeky” subjects like math and stats and programming, and enjoy talking to people about it, but don’t want to do a PhD and want to end up in industry.

The issue with this is that I feel with my personality, I’m going to have a hard time really climbing the ladder in DS.

I could do the hard skills and technical part very well, but the people related stuff I find myself to be kind of intimidated by.

For example, in a previous internship, I had no problem taking the project my manager had for me, completing it quickly, picking up new tasks, doing those, and just getting things done. Head down doing the work, communicating with my manager, and moving on. 

However, sometimes he would say “hey I don’t think I can make this meeting with product team and marketing team, can you just talk about updates to our work here from the last few weeks?”.

And whenever he said that I’d just have this massive pit in my stomach, and be dreading that call the full day. 

It’s weird because I thought it was social anxiety, but outside of work in casual, nightlife settings I’m very comfortable talking to people.

It’s just when it’s work related I think I feel like I’m being judged and can’t really act the same.

I also find myself actively avoiding roles which say “client facing” in the JDs too cause of this fear

I was surprised to find that there’s a whole body of literature, on designing experimental design methods based on optimization procedures. Bandits, some techniques with reinforcement learning, and other optimization algorithms have been used in experimental design. This seems quite interesting that the current state of experimental design is doing this kind of work, by using algorithmic/optimization approaches.

My question to you all, is that is this an area which gets much support in statistics departments?

When I asked her if her MS stats background was a valuable in asset in her analytics strategy role, she said that in fact, no it was the opposite, and she said she didn’t get respect from any higher ups for having a technical background. She feels she could have accelerated quicker due to an MBA, rather than a MS in statistics.

I’m taking a computational statistics class and we are learning a wide variety of statistical computing tools for inference, involving Monte Carlo methods, bootstrap methods, jackknife, and general Monte Carlo inference. 

If it’s one thing I’ve learned is how powerful the bootstrap is. In the book I saw an example of bootstrapping regression coefficients. In general, I’ve noticed that bootstrapping can provide a very powerful tool for understanding more about parameters we wish to estimate. Furthermore, after doing some researching I saw the connections between the bootstrapped distribution of your statistic and how it can resembles a “poor man’s posterior distribution” as Jerome Friedman put it. 

After looking at the regression example I thought, why don’t we always bootstrap? You can call lm() once and you get a estimate for your coefficient. Why wouldn’t you want to bootstrap them and get a whole distribution? 

I guess my question is why don’t more things in stats just get bootstrapped in practice? For computational reasons sure maybe we don’t need to run 10k simulations to find least squares estimates. But isn’t it helped up to see a distribution of our slope coefficients rather than just one realization?

Here's the scoop: LYZR.ai is a data science analytics platform aimed at being user-friendly and versatile, designed so anyone can roll up their sleeves and start running simple to complex analytics on their data sets, without needing a dedicated data science or analysis team.  
Tired of spending endless hours wrestling with spreadsheets, macros, and power queries? Or feeling stifled by Power BI or Tableau's limited capabilities? And even the best brains get stuck beyond a certain point wondering 'what to analyze?'. These are the core issues that LYZR.ai is looking to combat.  
But enough from me. I want to hear your raw, unfiltered opinions. What are the strong points of LYZR.ai, and where does it fall short? Is the concept clear, or am I missing the mark?

I have a bachelors in business and logistics management, MS in supply chain management, and I’m working on an MBA in business analytics. I have applied for English speaking roles I find on LinkedIn, but I don’t know how to find companies willing to offer visa sponsorship.

I want to emigrate to Poland once my contract expires. My language level is probably only A1 or A2, I’d also be grateful for any recommended resources to learn the language. It’s just been difficult balancing work, school and trying to study Polish.

I've been working as a Data Analyst for a year now, using SQL, Excel, and Tableau, and have another year in Business Intelligence. I'd like to dive more into Data Science.  


I was looking at some alternatives that fit my budget and GA Techs OMSA comes up and this particular Master in Data Science from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, which is highly ranked, #1 in Latin America, and #104 globally. Link: [https://www.coursera.org/degrees/magister-en-ciencia-de-datos-ucchile](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/magister-en-ciencia-de-datos-ucchile)  


Since it's in Spanish (I'm a Spanish speaker) I will provide some details:  


**Cost**: $10k, up to 25% discount in early application and enrollment. So the cost can decrease to $7500  
**Platform**: Coursera  
**Duration:** 24 months, 22 hours weekly  
**Requirements**: 2 years of work experience in a related area, motivation letter, and vague details on GPA for Bachelors which should be in Data Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, Basic Sciences, or *other related areas*.  Proficiency in intermediate-level programming. Equivalent to at least an Introduction to Programming MOOC (in Python, R, SQL). Spanish proficiency.  


**Required Courses:**  
Introduction to Programming in Python 

Databases 

Data Analysis in Python 

Introduction to Data Science 

Data Visualization 

Statistical and Computational Learning 

Software Engineering 

Massive Data Processing 

Responsible Data Science 

Time Series

&#x200B;

**Elective Courses**:

Deep Learning 

Recommender Systems 

Image processing 

Applied Statistics 

Bayesian methods 

Social Network Analysis 

&#x200B;

From the FAQ I found these interesting questions: 

  
1.  **Is the program accredited?‎** 

No, since it is not a requirement in Chile. However, the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile presents the highest accreditation given by the National Accreditation Commission of Chile. 

 2. **Will there be a graduation ceremony?‎** 

Yes, a graduation ceremony will be held remotely and you will receive your physical diploma.   


3. **Can I switch between the online program and in-person?**

 No, since this program does not exist in an  in-person format.   


**4. Are there internships or internships that are part of the program?**

This program, for the moment, does not include student exchanges or internships.

&#x200B;

I would like what your thoughts are. It seems to be good for a very affordable price. I think it's fairly new, started in 2021 or so. I haven't been able to find any reviews from students taking it. I plan to move to the US in \~5 years when I get my residency permit. I guess a Master's from a US University would have more weight? What do you guys think about the coursework? They also like GATech provide a $2000 Micro Master MOOC that you can later transfer. Anyway, let me know what you guys think about this option. Thanks!

Note I want all names to show, just not the checkboxes ticked.

This helps because if new data is loaded it could be hundreds of names making the dashboard cluttered. So by always having this ‘Market Average’ set value by default, my dashboard will look clean.

I've been asked to work on a tableau workbook that brings in hundreds of names from a table. These names are in a filter box, with checkboxes. They asked me to look for a way in which it is hard coded into Tableau, so that only 1-2 names are PRE Selected when they open the final version, which is embedded in some kind of webpage.

The reason for this is that when the final user opens the web page, all the names are automatically selected and the graphs are all over the place full of data, making the graphs unreadable.

I thought that a Tableau workbook, when published, will be published with the filters that were applied and saved with, but they are telling me thats not the case?

I'm 27, and graduated in business back in 2019. Knowing Excel was able to carry me over from a support role all the way to Business Intelligence Manager, my current job. But, I feel I work on nothing BI-related. My position should actually be called Performance Analyst Manager. I work exclusively on Google Sheets/Excel, doing what I feel is basic analysis on performance metrics such as Avg Handle Time, Contacts per Hour, Attrition, Avg Speed of Answer, Customer Satisfaction,etc. I do this on a daily basis for multiple programs \~15.

As a manager I help other Performance Analysts learn how to think and answer Business Questions, use pivot tables, and create appropriate graphs for the data they are using, all within Excel and Google Sheets.

The deepest analysis I was working on, is a linear regression in Excel on how different parameters such as Friendliness, knowledge, Ease of Doing Business,etc may affect Customer Satisfaction. I wasn't able to finish this as I lacked statistics knowledge on normalizing my data, multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity.

I would like to apply to Data Analysts positions, but many require Python Knowledge, R and Statistics. I've taken Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis on Udemy, and currently on Course 5/8 for the Google DA Certificate. As a note, I have Coursera Enterprise from my company and I can basically take any course there for free.I'd like your help on how to show my current skills on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-chacon/) and CV to get an entry-level Data Analyst position. I get rejected from all the 100+ positions I've applied, so I assume I'm doing something wrong.

The courses on Coursera that I have saved that I want to do in order after the Google DA are:

Can I use some data from my company to create external projects? Obviously changing names from John to Agent 1. I just can't figure out what to do that would impress a hiring manager.

I just feel lost and overwhelmed about what I should do to get a job as Data Analyst, one of those that asks for Python, SQL, Tableau, and Statistics proficiency. I don't know how to look at data in a statistical way. I feel I shouldn't even have my current company role, as someone that really knows BI would do such a better job.

I'd also like to continue my education and I've looked at some Masters such as GA Tech's OMSCS, but everyone at r/OMSCS says you shouldn't try taking this if you don't come from a CS background. What can you guys recommend on this part?

Job B offered a Business Intelligence Manager position, $1600 for 2 months trial period and then bump to $2000 after trial. 14 salaries, government insurance.

Job A counter offered to change my position to Business Intelligence/Data Analyst and bump from $1500 to $2100.

Job A is more relaxed, provides traveling flexibility, time flexibility to study Masters Degree

Job B is more time-consuming, stressful but better job and better experience for Resume as its management.

The episode is from his point of view, and it seems to be before the afterlife, but it’s like a dream. I found it very similar to the idea for International Assassin. 

Tony checks into a hotel, at some point he has lost his ID (he picked up the wrong suitcase) and he starts impersonating the guy whose ID he has. He’s kind of lost and not sure what he has to do, until he tries to find out more about this guy so he can find him. He is invited to a party but ends up not going in. It’s suggested that this would have been him dying, which can be similar to drinking the water.

There is an excessive reliance on paper qualifications in today's society. Individuals pursue university degrees, yet there is minimal distinction between them and their peers who have also obtained similar qualifications. 

 2. Be adaptable  

It is essential to enter the world with the understanding that the most important skill acquired in university is the capability to learn. You must be adaptive. 

 3. There is no shortcut  

Millennials believe that within a few weeks of being employed, they will acquire the highest position in the company and get the land cruiser.  Progress is a gradual process and that, regardless of the era, it takes time to achieve success. 

 4. Be hungry  

Grab opportunities that present themselves, as they may never present themselves again. 

 5. Learn the art of gratitude.  

Be grateful for what you have. Take a moment, write the things that you are grateful for, you would be amazed. Those who are grateful tend to be more content and agreeable than those who only think about the ""unfortunate"" moments. 

6. Lose the sense of entitlement

  
7. Move with the times    

In the current digital era, individuals from different parts of the world are seizing opportunities, and unless we act quickly, we may soon be left behind.    

8. Are your skills important in today's world    

Stay ahead of the game by reading and learning, you need to be more knowledgeable than others.

9. Study what the market needs    

Create your own space, rather than simply replicating what someone else does. Investigate what the market requires.    

10. Fix the problem    

It is unnecessary to recreate a product that already exists. As Jack Ma observes, China will not have a another Jack Ma , as they already have one.    

11. You aren't perfect

There is an excessive reliance on paper qualifications in today's society. Individuals pursue university degrees, yet there is minimal distinction between them and their peers who have also obtained similar qualifications. 

 2. Be adaptable  

It is essential to enter the world with the understanding that the most important skill acquired in university is the capability to learn. You must be adaptive. 

 3. There is no shortcut  

Millennials believe that within a few weeks of being employed, they will acquire the highest position in the company and get the land cruiser.  Progress is a gradual process and that, regardless of the era, it takes time to achieve success. 

 4. Be hungry  

Grab opportunities that present themselves, as they may never present themselves again. 

 5. Learn the art of gratitude.  

Be grateful for what you have. Take a moment, write the things that you are grateful for, you would be amazed. Those who are grateful tend to be more content and agreeable than those who only think about the ""unfortunate"" moments. 

6. Lose the sense of entitlement

  
7. Move with the times    

In the current digital era, individuals from different parts of the world are seizing opportunities, and unless we act quickly, we may soon be left behind.    

8. Are your skills important in today's world    

Stay ahead of the game by reading and learning, you need to be more knowledgeable than others.

9. Study what the market needs    

Create your own space, rather than simply replicating what someone else does. Investigate what the market requires.    

10. Fix the problem    

It is unnecessary to recreate a product that already exists. As Jack Ma observes, China will not have a another Jack Ma , as they already have one.    

11. You aren't perfect    

If you feel completely satisfied, then you are not pushing yourself to your full potential. You have not accomplished enough.    

12.  Read and read some more

* We have to agree that variables names are an essential part of the source code and meaningful names are important when it comes to program comprehension.
* They serve as an implied documentation that should convey to the reader;
* Considering that sometimes names are the only documentation, then clean code approach should be highly regarded.
* Therefore, it is important to devote a considerable amount of time to the issue of variable naming and therefore the variable names and rules.

## Variable Names Rules & Guidelines

* A variable name *CAN* be one word, though not a Must
* You *SHOULD* separate words with underscores and not spaces.
* When naming variable's we *SHOULD* only use alpha-numeric characters (letters and numbers) and the underscore character.
* You *SHOULD NOT* start a variable name with a number, but can start with a letter or an underscore character. Breaking this rule will give you an invalid decimal literal or syntax error
* A variable name *SHOULD* start with a letter or the underscore character.
* You *SHOULD NOT* use python keywords and function names as variable names.
* Variable names are case sensitive message, Message, MESSAGE and MeSsAge are different
* Ensure that variable names are; Short: though they can be long. Descriptive: That is can tell what the variable is used for.
* Take note that some letters like lowercase l and uppercase letter O can easily be confused with number 1 and 0.
* While it is legal to use upper case letters; Others think it is a good idea to start variable names with lower case letter. Others believe that they better use camel case than separate names with_ . Others avoid starting variables names with an underscore, unless when they are writing library code.

Hey,

I am going to be applying for (junior - senior) year summer internships in August for SWE roles. I go to a T15-T20 CS school, i am a double major in Data Science and Comp Sci. I will be applying to Faang-like companies or a Top bank (would love to live in NYC). 

Rn, my resume consists of two internships. One is software engineering for a startup and another is data analytics for a big company. I am going to have two decent sized projects  on there. And include a data science club (or my own club I founded if it gets approved for this upcoming semester) on there to.

Hey,

I am going to be applying for (junior - senior) year summer internships in August for SWE roles. I go to a T15-T20 CS school, i am a double major in Data Science and Comp Sci. I will be applying to Faang-like companies or a Top bank (would love to live in NYC). 

Rn, my resume consists of two internships. One is software engineering for a startup and another is data analytics for a big company. I am going to have one relatively big (kinda impressive) project on there. (Heard it’s better to have one big project than a bunch of small projects). And include a data science club on there to. I also might list school projects, on there. 

Now this is my question. Should I include I was an EMR (Emergency Medical Responder — rides on an ambulance and provides support to EMTs during calls) on my resume throughout high-school? I always thought it was a good thing and relatively impressive, but now I’m second guessing that it’s irrelevant.

No clue what they are talking about

Ask any question slightly out of their scope of study; it gets responded with “you should schedule a meeting with that [study] advisor”. 

I have never heard of a single person who has enjoyed their advisor or built any sort of relationship with them. 

They all sound like robots. For example, I will say I am hardworking student and I’m going to have a good amount of time next semester, I think I can take three CS courses. The response will be “all I can say is the CS department recommends 2 courses.” 

They don’t adjust to you as a person at all. They just say the same thing to everyone. 

Just one of my pet peeves, that we all pay so much to go here to have advisors who are more similar to robots than humans.

I am in a rotational data analyst program at an insurance company while getting my masters in CS. My plan is to interview to become a data scientist at my company when my rotations and masters program are complete in 1.5 years.

Hey Data Engineers!,

For the past 2 years I've been working on a library to automate the most tedious part of my own work - data loading, normalisation, typing, schema creation, retries, ddl generation, self deployment, schema evolution... basically, as you build better and better pipelines you will want more and more.

The value proposition is to automate the tedious work you do, so you can focus on better things.

So dlt is a library where in the easiest form, you shoot response.json() json at a function and it auto manages the typing normalisation and loading.

In its most complex form, you can do almost anything you can want, from memory management, multithreading, extraction DAGs, etc.

The library is in use with early adopters, and we are now working on expanding our feature set to accommodate the larger community.

Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features or destinations.

The library is open source and will forever be open source. We will not gate any features for the sake of monetisation - instead we will take a more kafka/confluent approach where the eventual paid offering would be supportive not competing. 

Here are our [product principles](https://dlthub.com/product/) and docs page and our [pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/dlt/).



I know lots of you are jaded and fed up with toy technologies - this is not a toy tech, it's purpose made for productivity and sanity.

### Hey Python data engineers!  Exciting news – an open-source Python library that's all about simplifying your data loading journey with schema evolution and declarative loading has arrived! 🚀

[dlt](https://dlthub.com/) is here to make your pipeline building smoother than ever before. We've put our hearts into creating a library that fits into your stack without any extra fuss. It's not just about pipelines – we're also offering ready-made solutions for common tasks.


Imagine having your data structured and normalized automatically during loading. Like JSON strings turning into proper datetime formats, columns renamed to fit the database and nested data unpacked to new tables, all thanks to dlt's [schema inference and schema evolution engine](https://dlthub.com/docs/reference/explainers/schema-evolution). This means less code, reduced maintenance, and data quality alerts at your fingertips. This paves the way for data meshing and the democratization of data loading through consumer-producer contracts. Row and column level lineage included via versioned schema.

If this sounds like your kind of tool, we'd be thrilled to have you in our community! Our team, our community, and myself are all here to assist you. Let's build something amazing together. [🌟 Join the conversation on our Slack community and let's embark on this data journey!](https://join.slack.com/t/dlthub-community/shared_invite/zt-1slox199h-HAE7EQoXmstkP_bTqal65g)


Check out this simple code example to see the magic in action:

```python
import dlt

# have data? dlt likes data. It will take lists of rows or generators.
data = [{'id': 1, 'name': 'John'}]

# open connection. Credentials can be passed directly or read from a toml/env.
pipe = dlt.pipeline(destination='snowflake',
                    dataset_name='raw_data')

# Upsert/merge: Update old records, insert new
job_status = pipe.run(data, 
					  write_disposition=""merge"",
                      primary_key=""id"", # declare the merge key from our json
                      table_name=""users"")

# DBT runner included, to not need to handle creds separately
venv = dlt.dbt.get_venv(pipe)
dbt = dlt.dbt.package(pipe,
					""https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop.git"",
					venv=venv)

models = dbt.run_all()

# Save outcomes to db for monitoring
pipe.run([job_status, models], table_name=""loading_status"")
```

For the past 2 years I've been working on a library to automate the most tedious part of my own work - data loading, normalisation, typing, schema creation, retries, schema inference, evolution & ddl generation, self deployment.. Basically, as you build better and better pipelines you will want more and more, and dlt supports those options.

The value proposition of this library is to automate the tedious work you do, so you can focus on better things.  


## What's special about dlt?

In the easiest form, you shoot response.json() json at a function and it auto manages the typing normalisation and loading, kind of like a pandas df.to\_sql() but with auto schema inference, versioning and evolution. It supports loading to files, databases, and soon table formats and vector dbs.

In its most complex form, you can do almost anything you can want, from memory management, microbatching, multithreading, extraction DAGs, 1 line Airflow/git actions deployment, dbt runner, streamlit app for data discovery, sql client, atomic state dictionaries, etc.

The library is in use with early adopters, and we are now working on expanding our feature set to accommodate the larger community. We are adding Athena + Iceberg and Weaviate vector dbs next.

## Free forever
The library is open source and will forever be open source. We will not gate any features for the sake of monetisation - instead we will take a more kafka/confluent approach where the eventual paid offering would be supportive not competing.

## Call for Feedback!
Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features or destinations.

I would particularly love to hear from you: What destinations are you looking for from such a tool? And what use cases do you usually have? I'm a data engineer so my knowledge is more around loading external sources to a common space.

Here is my proposed data/analytic pipeline:

1. Data source: use a local python script to extract prices of BTC and ETH from APIs such as coingecko or flipside, every 5 min. I will likely also extract tweets on these cryptocurrency so I can later conduct a sentiment analysis as a predictor for their price forecast.
2. The raw, extracted data will be stored in the local postgresql database
3. Data transformation will be done in dbt
4. Sentiment analysis (for tweets) will be performed with a pretrained model (i.e., VADER sentiment classifier), I will either do it locally or via pySpark (like to hear some thoughts from others)
5. Once the data is transformed and sentiment and price prediction is generated, it will be loaded into a snowflake data warehouse

Also, there is a chance these speakers have wiring that are connected to the central audio system (in a theatre room) behind the wall. I don't need to connect to this central system if I can avoid it. I much rather connect is with my phone or smart TV/chromcast TV/laptop if possible.

My question is: Is it worth it to turn down this offer for the opportunity of something better?

I have two options at hand. 

**Option 1: Take the return offer**

**Pros**

* Good six-figure pay with a $20k sign-on and available target bonuses
* The location has a low cost of living
* Hybrid, very lenient work-life balance

**Cons**

* I'm stuck with the company for two years
* There isn't much to do in the town
* No friends or family within 800 miles of the location
* Can't pursue a master's program aside from the local university

**Option 2: Pursue a Master's degree/higher paying role**

**Pros**

* More flexibility in career and education
* Can stay in the city where my friends and family live
* Can find a potentially better role or even a prestigious Master's program in statistics OR cs

**Cons**

* Nothing is guaranteed; had a really hard time getting this internship in the first place
* Potentially lower pay or even no money if companies don't take me
* Have to focus on applications for both jobs and universities in the fall

I've realized that I am not very good at visualizing or picturing in 3D. I am comfortable with proof writing in real analysis, linear algebra or basic abstract algebra but when it comes to evaluating a triple integral, I suck at it.

For ""simple"" surfaces like spheres and other conics, I'm usually okay. I can draw level curves or level sets. But when it comes to weird surfaces which are the intersection of 1 sphere and another plane (or something similar), my brain stops functioning.

Apologies if this question has a physics-y / computer science flavor.

I'm studying 3D computer vision and the book I'm using has a chapter on rigid body motion. I want to understand the connection between angular velocity, skew symmetric matrices and the exponential map from so(3) to SO(3).

Here is my current understanding.

1. For every vector w (omega) in R\^3, there is a skew symmetric matrix W and vice versa.
2. ""Continuous rotations"" in R\^3 are elements of SO(3). If R(t), a rotation matrix is an element of SO(3), then R\*R\^T = I \[I have suppressed the dependence on time and R\^T is the transpose of R\].
3. Taking derivatives on both sides gives the result that R\_dot \* R\^T is a skew symmetric matrix. By bullet point 1, there is a vector w in R\^3 whose matrix (skew symmetric) is R\_dot \* R\^T. \[R\_dot = dR/dt\]

I don't focus on the goals too much, I try to build systems/processes that help me achieve what I want. Life looks very rosy. 

HOWEVER- Because of what I did a decade ago, I've had episodes of anxiety, depression, guilt and sleeplessness. I have tried very hard to let go of the past and enjoy the present moment.

I've been thinking a lot about my data science career and I was wondering if there's a universal opinion on becoming a generalist vs a specialist.

To give you some context, I have worked extensively on images and videos for 7+ years (a lot of deep learning) and a few months ago, I shifted to tabular data (fraud detection). Here are some of my observations.

1. I enjoy solving problems in images, text, video and audio domains compared to anything else (Thanks to my background in signal and image processing). I am not very fond of other domains. 

2. I understand that solving a fraud problem is intellectually very challenging and the stakes are high. I also know that I'm going out of my comfort zone (which is a good thing) and exploring areas outside of computer vision.

3. I'm facing the explore and exploit dilemma. I can exploit my experience in deep learning, specialize in it, and become a ""subject matter expert"" (whatever that means) in computer vision, audio data etc. This will involve going deep down the rabbit hole in these areas. 

4. There's the other option of becoming a jack of all trades, get good experience in other domains and work on projects outside my comfort zone. This may also involve obtaining a lot of domain and business knowledge.

However, my career interests are within the computer vision domain. I'm ready to explore and grow within this field. I don't want to be a jack of all trades and work on every possible domain in data science.

I work as a data scientist in India in a globally well known organization. I'm kinda good at what I do. I write decent code, get along well with people and I'm very good at math/statistics (that's required for the job). I've been in this data science business for 8 years. 

However, I'm only in this field for the money. Nothing else. I graduated with a masters in space systems engineering and my plan was to go into space companies. Unfortunately it flopped for a variety of reasons and I had to switch to data science.

Despite being good in my field, I hate it with a passion. I want to go back to the space industry (or something related) but I wonder if it's too late. I'm paid well enough to support my wife and 8+ month baby but I don't see myself writing code or analysing data everyday for the rest of my life.

I have been thinking of getting a PhD in math or physics or something similar and going into pure research (either academia or industry) eventually. I understand that academia/PhD has its downsides but that's for another discussion. What I do know is I don't want to be in IT even if it pays me well. I like conventional engineering more (I was an engineering graduate, not a CS student). 

I don't want to quit my job in haste. I want to do it smartly. However, I don't know if a tech career exists outside of IT/software engineering / CS.

My daughter is 8.5 months old. My wife, mother and I take care of her (We live in India where it's okay for a married couple to live with parents). I work on my tech day job whereas my wife has extended her maternity leave to spend quality time with our daughter.

Things are going largely okay but it has been more than a month since my wife and I have slept properly at night. My daughter wakes up almost every hour for multiple reasons (feed, diaper, sleep issues and what not). I feel really exhausted in the morning and this has affected my performance at work. Before my daughter was born, I was really good at all jobs I've held in my life. I consider myself to be technically competent at what I do. 

While my managers understand this (they're dads to toddlers) and kinda know my issues, I've received negative feedback from them at work. My skills and work ethics have been questioned. I'm also dealing with some mental health issues of my own (anxiety, depression, low self esteem outside of work etc) and am in therapy for 1.5+ years. Adding to my troubles is the constant anxiety about the fact that my daughter hasn't started crawling yet (I understand that she'll crawl at her own pace). Sometimes, I think I'm not doing enough as a father, though my wife says I do a lot. I think it's sleep deprivation that has affected my work performance but I'm not sure.

Apologies for the long post. I'm utterly confused in my career.

I'm looking forward to advance my skill sets in computer vision (CV) and need your help in taking the next steps. 

I have been working as a machine learning engineer for 7-8 years. I've done some cool industrial computer vision projects spanning sectors like consumer electronics, healthcare, retail and social media. I'm quite conversant with mathematics at the masters level, signal and image processing, 2D computer vision and of course machine/deep learning. 

I chose to take a break from CV and decided to venture into designing ML models for tabular data which was probably the biggest mistake of my career. I hate writing SQL statements to transform data into the format I want or use Xgboost over and over again. I am least interested in learning Spark, hive, Mongo, <insert any fancy data engineering technology>. On the other hand, I love geometry, curves and surfaces. 

I want to get back to doing vision again but I want to move beyond the usual image classification, segmentation and object detection projects. What are some good resources to look at and study? 

Here are my areas of interests
1. AR/VR/XR
2. Robotics and autonomous vehicles
3. Computational imaging - I'm fascinated by how we can design next generation of imaging systems with the help of computers. Many of my courses in grad school were centered around optics, solid state devices, sensors and imaging systems. 
4. Computer graphics
5. Medical imaging

I want my future jobs to revolve only around images and videos. I'm probably demanding a lot but I'm exactly sure of what kind of ML I don't want to do in life.

I'm of those (rare??) persons who does ML for a living but has no interest in doing it. I've built models using classical and deep learning approaches for 7-8 years, and a lot of them had decent impacts in the companies I've worked with. I'm good at what I do and I'm compensated well for it. However, nothing in the field of ML/DL excites me anymore.

I find it more enjoyable to solve problems in my math textbooks . In fact, I want a career in which I can do some form of mathematics but I don't want to do machine learning for the rest of my life. Before I shifted to ML for the money, I worked a lot on satellite systems engineering. I also took a lot of physics and EE courses during my masters degree (optics, quantum mechanics and solid state devices).

I was thinking of a career in quantum information but I don't have a PhD yet. Also, my computer science skills aren't strong enough to switch to cryptography. Any thoughts / ideas on how to get out of machine learning?

\[2\] I came across this course recently - [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/6838\_spring\_2021.html](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/6838_spring_2021.html). This one looks super exciting. Here's a course on discrete differential geometry that I found online -  [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/). I'd love to explore differential geometry applied to ML problems (or vice versa).

\[3\]  I would prefer to work on ML in fields like applied physics or genetics rather than banking, social media analytics or consumer electronics.

\[4\] (This is a short rant)-  I'm sick of technical papers that have titles like ""X is all you need"" or ""Your classifier is secretly an energy based model and you should treat it like one"". I have nothing against anyone here and I'm absolutely certain that the authors are 100000x more knowledgable than I am but I'm very uncomfortable with such pompous paper titles. Correct me if I'm wrong but I haven't seen catchy titles in physics or mathematics. This is one (trivial) reason why I don't want to pursue a PhD in ML. I hate the grandeur and style!!

\[5\] Rant 2- Taking any online course from any platform does NOT make you a data scientist or an ML researcher. I hate the fact that not many of them are not willing to put in the time/effort to learn the fundamental math behind ML algorithms. When I ask someone in an interview to explain what PCA is, they stop with the answer that PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique. No word about eigenvalues/eigenvectors or covariance matrix. :(

I have a fairly decent understanding of computer architecture. And I've been working on the machine learning sector for 7 years. I consider myself ""technically competent"". 

 In my undergrad and grad life, I was in love with electronic communications, optics and solid state physics. I've taken undergraduate and graduate level courses in QM (Griffiths and Sakurai). I have a masters degree but not a PhD.

I'm in the early stages of planning a project using bayesian statistical models that might benefit from a GPU. I'm looking for any advice / pointers on what hardware I should consider. 

The project is more beefy than what I would run on a PC, but significantly less than some of the ML/AI projects that get pushed to the cloud.

As I understand it (I barely do), that library supports GPUs with OpenCL (e.g. NVIDIA).

* Should I be looking at GPUs specific to computation? Or, am I looking at gaming GPUs?
* I understand that GPU memory is more relevant that the number of cores. Are there other variables I should focus on?
* Based on what's currently available in the market, is it worth it to spend money on a better GPU? Or go with the cheapest? I understand that GPUs sometimes scale inefficiently. I wonder if most of the benefit comes from the initial hurdle of pushing to a GPU, with much fewer benefit of scale thereafter.

I heard this claim before, but those results were not published in their Nature (2021) article. This is one of the few credible mentions of that unpublished result. 

I think we need a more nuanced understanding of how to work with dissociation. That's a much bigger topic. But at the least, that understanding should reflect the science: MDMA is an excellent for dissociation. Part of the nuance might come from the same article mentioned above: 

> The trick to working with dissociation is not to ignore the gold that is boredom in favor of other juicy bits that are more interesting to the mind... The seeming non-response is the access point to go deeper. One of the gifts of many psychedelics, and certainly of both cannabis and MDMA, is that they generate a profoundly embodied, visceral, ‘here and now' experience... Our recommendation is to stay with that experience even though it does not fit the client's idea of how the session should be.",False,False,mdmatherapy,"""Data suggests that participants with dissociative subtypes responded to MDMA more so than those without"" - Rick Doblin",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mdmatherapy/comments/13x68ls/data_suggests_that_participants_with_dissociative/

For the first time, I did not follow an extended tapper off my antidepressant. The results were slightly less ‘magical’, but no less therapeutic, and much less destabilizing. Based on these results, I fully intend to not taper off antidepressants when I work with MDMA in the future. 

I take 75mg Effexor (Venlafaxine) daily, which has a half life of only a few hours. I previously followed the MAPS protocol in my MDMA sessions: I would tapper down to a half dose for one week, followed by a two week wash out before my MDMA sessions. I was sometimes able to stay off the Effexor for a few months, but ultimately decided it was better to stay on it.

I decided to try MDMA at least once without tapering off the antidepressant. Instead, I simply did not take my regular dose of Effexor on the day before or day of my MDMA session. I was aware this might decrease the ‘magic’ — but I use MDMA exclusively for therapeutic intent and never for recreation. I was also concerned about the hypothetical risk of serotonin syndrome. But according to a [MAPS study from last year](https://old.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/vnxw5s/maps_study_reported_cases_of_serotonin_syndrome/), the actual occurrence of serotonin syndrome from MDMA is quite low. My psychiatrist also agreed the risk was small. 

As is typical with my sessions, I took a 150mg initial dose, followed by a 75mg booster, and the session lasted three hours. The session was more ‘in my head’ than ‘in my body’. That was fine by me. I use MDMA for PTSD: My intentions are focused on very specific traumatic memories and triggering thoughts. I know what those memories and thoughts are even without taking MDMA. But the key feature of MDMA was still present. I was able to *feel* though the associated painful emotions and process them into less painful forms. I immediately continued my regular dose of Effexor the next day. 

What role antidepressants should play is one of the big unanswered questions when working with MDMA. I know the often given advice is to tapper off antidepressants, and indeed that’s what I did for over a year. But there’s a dearth of experiential data on what happens when antidepressants are not tapered. Obviously, even though continuing antidepressants without a taper will be the right choice for me, it can’t be said its right for others. Some antidepressants have half-lives of several days (e.g. Fluoxetine). But I’m suspicious that there will be a growing ‘middle ground’ where continuing antidepressants at the cost of less magic is still worth it for many.",False,False,mdmatherapy,Results of MDMA session after not tapering off SNRI,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mdmatherapy/comments/12ipyqi/results_of_mdma_session_after_not_tapering_off/

I did my sixth session in December, which, as with all previous sessions, was an inner journey with music and a blindfold. I always work with a sitter who can respond if needed, but they are more involved before and after the session with setting intentions and integration. 

I was emotionally flooded in that session. I 'broke through' some dissociation (not on purpose), which unleashed a wave of panic the medicine could not keep calm. I was fine, and my sitter helped me through the moment, but I don't know that I benefited from the experience. I was pretty disregulated for a few weeks before the dissociation returned. 

I'm considering instead sitting up without a blindfold and free associating with my sitter. I guess I could always close my eyes and go inward if it calls for me. But I've never had my eyes open on MDMA -- I've always used a blindfold -- so I have no idea how the experience might be different. 

On one hand, I imagine conversing with my sitter will provide an additional resource with which to approach the repressed emotions.

One of the reasons why I want to burn-in at the RIAD level, rather than the disk level (e.g. SMART test or badblocks), is because I'm concerned about my PSUs ability to power multiple drives running simultaneously. All of my issues over the last few weeks have been when the disks passed both SMART and badblocks, but the RAID failed over and over. I followed advice online and since upgraded my PSU and power cables. 

I had the idea that I could just torrent a massive amount of data for a week. This would effectively stress the I/O in proportion to its anticipated use.

Integration is often recommended as a critical component of psychedelic therapy, but variation in the specifics suggest a lack of consensus in its role. Integration to one person means something different to another: coloring books, walks through nature, listening to music, or just kicking the can to a vaguely named ‘integration therapist’ (who themselves brings their own interpretation of the idea). Its practice could benefit if grounded in similar theories elsewhere in psychotherapy. 

I was surprised to read about the importance of integration in some background reading on Coherence Therapy. Its fundamental idea is a conflict between a conscious ‘anti-symptom’ position (e.g. “I cannot speak with confidence”) and an unconscious ‘pro-symptom’ position (e.g. “not speaking with confidence keeps me safe”). Coherence Therapy uses experiential techniques to bring the pro-symptom position into conscious awareness. A better understanding from the source references is worth the read. 

From [**Depth Oriented Brief Therapy** by Ecker and Hulley (p.25)](https://usa1lib.org/book/2711771/18528a):

> When the pro-symptom emotional reality has been deeply unconscious, the client’s initial experiencing of it is a very state specific knowing, a quite altered state that may be lucid at the time but it's likely not to be retained in awareness when the client returns to the very different reality in his or her habitual, conscious position. This is to be expected, and a focused process of integration is needed in order for the client to maintain access to the pro-symptom view of reality and consistently relate to the problem from it, rather than from the anti-symptom position. 

And from [**Unlocking the Emotional Brain** by Ecker, Robin, and Hulley (p.49)](https://libgen.li/edition.php?id=137262199):

> Richards fresh new awareness of why he avoids speaking with confidence occurred in an altered state – an area of emotional experience not normally connected to conscious awareness, as is typically the case with any newly conscious emotional truth – so it was likely to disappear from awareness again if no further steps were taken to help integrate it into routine, ongoing, stable awareness. The therapist therefore pursued integration, Coherence Therapy’s next stage, through the creation of integration experiences, which are simply repeated experiences of the discovered material both during and between sessions. Stable integration into every day awareness completes the retrieval of a symptom–requiring schema from implicit memory into explicit awareness.

> The essence of an integration exercise lies in having the client again speak from and within the felt emotional reality of the pro-symptom position, expressing it as his or her own emotional truth. What matters is for the client repeatedly to have a bodily experience of the emotional realness of the discovered material – not necessarily a cathartic, dramatic, or intense experience, but in unmistakably embodied, authentic one.

These ideas suggest why my own experience with transcribing the audio recordings from my journeys helped my own integration. Listening to the audio recalls memories that were created in a non-ordinary state, where I then write them down to be retained from my habitual, conscious position. I often listen to the audio repeatedly to get everything down on paper, which I can then periodically review. I’m sure other integration activities similarly fit the mold.",False,False,PsychedelicTherapy,A Theory of Integration from Coherence Therapy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychedelicTherapy/comments/x9791e/a_theory_of_integration_from_coherence_therapy/

The intention was to feel my way into the journey; to feel the emotions — the same painful emotions I’m familiar with from my regular meditation practice. 

The beginning of the journey went according to plan. By one small modification to the ceremony agreed upon ahead of time, I kept the room to myself for the first twenty minutes to meditate. This put me in a familiar headspace where I could evoke my emotions. After that, my guide came into the room and without any chit chat I lied down in the shavasana position with palms turned up — a very vulnerable position — while he began another twenty minute guided body-scan meditation. By this point my only effort was toward relaxing into my distress, to allow the emotions to arise, and to not get int the way. True to my intentions, I held my emotions out like an offering to the medicine. Then I waited. 

The first sign of the medicine came about forty minutes in through slight muscle tremors in my right shoulder and the side of my leg. I only noticed them because I was so relaxed. I knew it was the medicine, because the muscles that twitched are muscles that don’t ordinarily move independently of their muscle group. It was a sign that the medicine was on its way, and if I stayed relaxed it would be with me shortly. I kept to my intentions; I kept my focus; I kept aware of my emotions. 

While the medicine was still weak, I could feel it begin to surround my emotions. The medicine was going right to where I was asking it to go and all I had to do was keep my awareness on my emotions. And then, in the first real act of healing, the emotions washed away in a single deep breath followed by a wave of relaxation. It was so gentle. It was so peaceful. No purge. No outburst of energy. Just a washing away. I scanned for more emotions. Since I was in the same headspace as my regular meditation practice, I knew where to find them. No thoughts; just feelings. MDMA is true medicine. Each time I reached for pain it vanished like salt in water. 

This being my second journey with MDMA, I was familiar with the medicine and how to work with it. I recalled from my first journey how I was ""going through the past and the present and.. all of the emotional charge attached to the memories...trying to find more charged memories so that I can experience them and then put them to bed.” By the same idea, I was feeling through my hurt and pain and letting the medicine wash them away. At one point I said, “any time I show her (MDMA) a wound, she heals it.” At another point I said, “Intentions are key. Awareness is key.” I was referring to the fact that I was walking the path I set out for myself — to feel rather than think my way into the journey — and that all I had to do was bring my awareness to the emotions and the medicine would meet me there. And then I reached for the next. One after another, things started to go deep.  

Every once in a while I would feel an emotion that would take a little longer for the MDMA to heal. Sometimes a second or more than the last. Eventually, some that took even longer than that. At one point I found an emotion so painful I physically tensed up out of the shavasana position to protect my heart. It took a while, but even that pain was eventually eased by the medicine. Around this time I started to notice the shift from ordinary into non-ordinary consciousness. 

A scuba diving analogy helps me think about what happened next. Typically, if one is diving only 30 feet below the surface, the diver can just jump in the water and swim down to the coral reef. But if one is diving 100 feet below the surface, there is enough residual buoyancy in the body that one needs to pull themselves down the anchor line to get deeper. That’s what I was doing. Each emotion I grabbed for was one hand in front of another along the anchor line down into my subconsciousness. Each successive emotion more painful than the last. At one point, I physically turned onto my side and curled into a fetal position. Eventually, I wasn’t in familiar territory anymore, and I said aloud that, “I’ve never been this deep before.” After listening to the audio recording, I was clearly in very labored breathing. I didn’t recognize it at the time, but I was clearly in a lot of pain. 

I’ve reflected on this experience of feeling my way deeper. Unfortunately, because I was in a non-ordinary state of consciousness, and because I wasn’t thinking about the experience, very little made its way into memory. On one hand, I wonder if each successive emotion felt was like following smoke to the fire. On the other hand, I wonder if releasing one emotion granted access to feel the next. Either way, I felt my way down into the depths and found… a child. It was me.

What happened next was characterized by the complete duality of the experience: I was simultaneously both myself — a 36 year old man — and this child — a prepubescent little boy. This was a hurt and frightened child. The hurt and pain I felt were that of this child. I immediately embraced him. As my body made another quarter turn, the child began to weep into the pillow. My guide recognized the transition, and without knowing what was going on in my inner world he rubbed my back. Little did he know that he was really rubbing the back of this child. 

Over the last few weeks, and last several months, I’ve wondered about where my fear came from. What was I so afraid of? If I only knew, then I could work it out. I thought my fear came from a time, place, or event. But it was not. The hurt, pain, and fear I felt were that of this little boy. There was nothing to work out; nothing to explain. I just held him. 

I understood the experience. I understand now that this child consciousness has been with me all this time. The human experience is additive, not subtractive, with adulthood built on top of childhood. But the inner child is still there. Temporally, it doesn’t make sense, but this child was hurt by the events of the last few years. As an adult, I was able to pack up, sell my house, and move across the country. But for this child, his basic needs for safety and security had been violated. And when a child gets hurt, understanding or rationalizing the situation does little to help them feel better. There was nothing to explain. Just compassionate embrace. 

This might sound like a magical experience, but I assure you it was quite upsetting. It forced me in that moment to take on the role of a parent; I found a sense of responsibility to take care of this child. This child was hurt, and I felt bad for letting that happen… for not being there when he needed me. I was concerned for this child. He is inside of me, a part of me, and when he’s hurt I feel it too. I laid this child down to rest in warm embrace. 

I felt my way through a lot of pain to go deep, and I was exhausted. About two hours after I took the medicine I ascended back to an ordinary state of consciousness. I was sad. I had to leave this child behind. My work was unfinished.  My time there was so brief. I slept the remaining three hours of the journey. That was very bizarre. People don’t usually sleep on an amphetamine. I’m only aware of [one theory](https://psychedelic.support/resources/why-psychedelic-therapies-may-not-work-for-you/) why someone would fall asleep in the middle of an MDMA journey. 

I was clearly shook up when I awoke. The guides noticed too. This experience took me deeper than where I had ever gone before. All I could really comment on was the depth of the experience. After sobering up, I went home and straight to bed. I slept soundly from 6:00 pm to 5:00 am and woke up sore and exhausted. 

Things have shifted in the days since — neither better nor worse. I’ve occasionally felt deeper into my emotions. I continue to rest well. Unlike my first journey, which left me joyful and exhilarated, this time was different. I was taken aback. Clearly, a lot happened, but at a depth I can’t assess. After listening to the audio — the breathing and the crying — I was in a lot more pain than I realized at the time. I can only hope the work that needed to get done, got done.

My intentions, regardless of choice, would be:
1. To look honestly at where I am in life. 
2. To forgive myself for not achieving the goals I set out for myself. 
3. To be at peace with an uncertain future. 
4. To let go of control. 

My intentions respond to ongoing depression and anxiety. I was hit hard, knocked down, and just never got back up. I became inert. If I knew why, I could work on the issues as part of my ongoing psychotherapy. 

I benefited from MDMA because I was able to re-process memories of a past event that intruded into my daily life; those memories were filed away into long-term memory during the session and haven’t bothered me since. Part of the reason the session was successful is because my intentions were very clearly set on revisiting that specific event. 

I will have more opportunities to work with my guides.

I coined it “emotional farming” and I’m struggling to map it to existing frameworks of attachment theory or elsewhere. I suspect my parents used me to satisfy their own emotional needs. But it’s difficult to assess when there are objective measures of relative privilege, and I *am* grateful for many things (e.g. we did, after all, have a roof over our heads). 

I recently recognized a similar pattern in several work failures that resulted in a serious career setback. Without getting into details, I was taken advantage of.

A previous overnight sleep study did not reveal any indicators of narcolepsy (in terms of REM onset or REM duration), which I am told is not conclusive without an MSLT (also since I'm on other drugs that suppress REM sleep). As I understand it, the diagnosis will ultimately depend on measuring the sleep latency during the MSLT. 

Here's the thing: I need to follow a routine ritual to go to sleep: I need to read for about 5-20 mins until I decide to turn over on my belly, which is when I usually fall asleep immediately. In cases where I haven't been able to follow the routine (like when I travel away from home without a book) I really struggle with the setting. 

I think if the clock starts when I turnover onto my belly, then I will have a sleep latency of less than a few minutes (at most). But if the clock starts as soon as they leave the room, and I read for 15 minutes, or if they don't let me read at all, then it could take much longer. 

At the very least, I am going to ask the sleep technician to note both the time they leave the room (start time A), and the time I turnover onto my belly (start time B), so that both measurements can be taken.

I'm not getting clear answers from my city's building department. What questions should I be asking?

**Background:** I'm looking to rebuild a 20' square free-standing deck off a hillside next to my house. There is a lake at the bottom of the hill, and about half of the existing deck is supported over the water by some very nice concrete piers. The old deck needs to be replaced because the wood is beginning to rot. Otherwise, there haven't been any issues (e.g. sagging) that would indicate a structural problem. It seems to have held up quite nicely in the many years before I bought the home. I have no contact with the previous owners. 

**The Issue:** The old deck was never permitted, and so the footings/piers were never inspected. I'd like to permit the new deck, but with the existing concrete piers. It seems impractical to install new piers (never mind the cost of removing old ones), and so reusing the existing piers is pretty much the condition under which I'll pull the permit. 

**The Building Department:** I live in a large city with a generally unhelpful building department that is not used to working directly with homeowners. I've called and asked twice about this issue, and received two different answers. One lady claims that I can proceed with something called an ""As-Built"" permit, which can ""legalize"" the existing piers. Another gentleman claims that I would need an engineering report to proceed (although, I have no idea how an engineer would sign-off without knowing the depth of the existing footings, and those footings are now underwater). So, I'm hearing one answer that sounds like it's an easy fix, and another like it's not. 

**The Question:** I realize that my specific situation depends on the codes that apply to me, but has anyone had experience with a similar situation? Either obtaining an ""As-built"" permit or by hiring an engineer to approve existing work? I generally like to know what I'm getting myself into *before* talking to any contractors, since I've learned (the hard way) that contractors can take advantage of ambiguous situations. 

**The Rant:** If pulling a permit becomes too costly or complex, then I'll have to consider rebuilding the new deck without a permit. I'm trying to do the right thing (within what I can afford). But the decision to go with unpermitted work was made by a previous owner before my time. Now the potential costs (e.g. engineering reports) might keep me from making it right.

I took this job because I got in a big jam with the pandemic and needed anything to pay me, and now I feel under-compensated making right around 50k, and as time continues it seems like the business as a whole is tightening up on promotions/new hires to meet quotas.

On the side, I am working on my master's in applied math to broaden my possibilities and differentiate myself from the thousands of other applicants on LinkedIn/indeed.

Originally, I planned on sitting in this position for a couple of years as I expected a pretty quick promotion/raise but with that possibility seemingly gone, I am now back to the drawing board on what I should do to advance my career. I see many with similar jobs post about how they have 2-3 YoE and make low to mid 6-figures. 

It makes me envious and uncomfortable in my current job as I feel under-compensated.Part of me wants to be patient, finish my grad degree, and stack skills and resume bullet points but I also feel an itch that I would be wasting time by doing that. To make it worse, the salary I receive is barely enough to cover living expenses, so I always feel incentivized to make more.

What do you guys think? What kind of things could I be doing to get the big jump in salary and a more rewarding job?

Background: 

I’m currently starting to study masters with a considerable interest in pursuing a PhD after my masters. I want to do this as I would like to do some research in implementing ai into healthcare with a different angle. Nonetheless the reason I want to do this is purely a passion. I don’t see myself becoming a professor or the next lead inventor for chatgpt medical edition. 

The main part: 

With a very brief background I would like to continue saying that while a PhD remains more of a passion based pursuet I will eventually still go into the working world of analytics and hopefully be able to work as a data analyst for a big company. My question really is:

1: how successful is a transition from research to corporate and company’s thinking your overqualified for the role. I’ve heard from people that phd people are considered overqualified for jobs simply for having a PhD and so they actually find it harder to get work compared to undergrad or masters. 

2: are there any benifits from doing a PhD when it comes to working (i don’t think so but then again I’m not in the industry yet)

I'm considering getting a ""work"" style laptop with good battery life, but then I think about the performance im leaving out and the potential gaming sessions between work, which puts me off from buying a laptop.

 I do have an iPad that I was thinking of using, but then I can't code, so it's. Still, then useless in those situations,  option is to get a MacBook air m2 or something . Yet I need clarification and trying to decide which route to take.

The file is a quickbooks file which will be opened by pcs on both sides of the network. The file is active and so it constantly updating and being shared around the network. 

The way this was working initially was we had a NAS that hosted the file. Everyone would access the Nas and no file would be sorted on any of the pc’s. Recently we opened a branch in another country and so after talking to some network engineer from there he told us to get the MX68 for both sides of the network and to set up a site to site vpn to allow access for the other branch to the NAS and therefore allowing them to use the file as if they were in office.

The struggle I’m having is the file will open here but not in the other branch. The latency of the vpn is +100ms. The internet speeds are a little affected and the ipsec policy apparently dosnt exist for this setup so we can’t see any computers on the other network.

She went on holiday, and when I did submit the documents, I was told this was all that was needed, only for the manager to come back to berate me about how I hadn't given proof of addresses that I was apparently told about. on the store's group chat she sent out a message at night about asking for proofs and at 9 am called me on my day off to send this all which I did no problem. when I came to my shift, I was asked to have a ""lil chat"", which went something like this:

manager: why aren't ur documents properly submitted? this isn't a joke I can't have u come to the store if they aren't submitted. 

me: when I gave them what I had asked, they said it was fine, and I even had another co-worker with me, and she saw as well 

Manager: idc you should send it, and I hate the fact that you don't pick up calls and reply when i message you. 

the manager then proceeds to essentially say I will cut your contract, and don't get on my bad side because I'm being very nice and lenient and that if you piss me off, ill make your life hell at work and make you work like ""soldiers""

I want to add here that I had given her my one week's notice (Uk requirement) a couple of weeks ago, and she basically said, ill cut your hours if you want, which I agreed with and stayed, but I assume my notice is still valid.

This was the most recent altercation. I also had one because I applied for another job within the airport, and they didn't like that. Now I really don't care about the job because I'm graduating in 3 weeks, and I rather put work time into the gym and look as good as I can rather than this job as I was planning to quit soon anyway.

After much research, I decided to go with this as I could spend more money on better lenses, which I did, and I haven't regretted this choice until now.

Before I start my current gear is as follows:

\- Sony a6400 

\- 2X 64GB Memory cards

\-Sigma 16mm/35mm/56mm

\-sigma 18-50mm 

using this gear, I have improved a lot to the point where recently, someone asked me to do their graduation shoot, which led to getting a client willing to pay for a graduation shoot for them as well. While this happened, I did a secondary shoot at my uncle's wedding, and everyone liked the pictures. I may have future clients lined up asking me to be their weddings' main shooters. With all of this going on, I've realised I've stepped into the professional realm. Having talked with other photographers at weddings and other places, the consensus was that I buy a full-frame camera and a Speedlight to become ""pro ready"". 

I did a lot of research, and because I'm on the sony ecosystems, my following upgrades would be either the a7iii or a7iv. But the question is, do I need them, or can I keep going with the a6400. I know with both cameras, a dual backup is a must, but apart from that and some low light advantage, is it worth spending that extra money. 

To further my question, should I get the a7iii or a7iv. I ask because the price jump for me is roughly $1000, and if I don't need to, then I rather not spend a lot on the a7iv, but at the same time, I want to be future-proof ready and not have to change cameras in 3-4 years.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for one year and eight months, and we go to university together. We started fooling around a couple of months into the relationship. Still, whenever we tried penetration, my girlfriend would be in pain, and we would stop as she would be uncomfortable and sometimes go back to oral or stop. We, at one point, started doing a lot of finger stuff which helped her be more comfortable, but we both think due to her low pain tolerance and some previous trauma with sex, she seems to be a Lil scared which I feel is amplifying that pain sensation. she enjoys oral, and she cums pretty quick (her words lmao) when it's oral, but when it comes to fingers one is ok, and she enjoys it, two or more is painful, and a dick is far away from the equation.

Tomorrow we came up with a plan (mostly her) that she will get a Lil drunk/tipsy to help her calm down and hopefully allow us to finally lose our virginities to one another. Still, I want to make sure I do everything I can in my reach to make this possible. Some people by now might be thinking I'm being too horny and being that kind of guy, but actually, It's because she is getting quite upset and mentally drained cause she thinks she's broken and she's not the ideal girlfriend all that. I have addressed this by talking to her and how perfect she is and i don't care as long as we are together, and it helps her, but I can tell she has this in the back of her mind because we both have a high sex drive which is being stopped due this problem we are facing

Ig, I'm here to ask you guys a final time before tomorrow about any tips and tricks and anything I should do to ensure success as she is super hyped, and we even booked a hotel and everything for tomorrow. We, ofc don't plan to jump right in and plan on watching doctor strange while she drinks, and then as it flows, we do it.

As someone who is overweight and struggles to maintain dry fasts due to life and commitments, I wanted to try and incorporate 24-hour dry ---> 24-hour wet ---> 24-hour dry, ---> repeat. 

I've looked at past posts, but nothing is conclusive enough information and data-wise to provide a solid answer to this question.

So I ask everyone that has done this form or similar form of fasting to please share your experience and whether this fasting method increases weight loss compared to water fasting. And for the people that incorporated exercise, how hard was it? How much did you guys exercise?

I've seen some posts talk about it but very vague so ig I'm here to get around advice to help me and others thinking about this. mainly I'm looking for how much weight loss and improvements on this plan to better optimise it

the plan I'm thinking of is pretty much:

Mon: dry

Tue: water

Wed: dry

Thur: water

Fri: dry

Sat: water 

Sun: food

and essentially slap this on repeat for 2 or 3 weeks at a time.

now to address the comments that will say this is unhealthy or why not slowly dry fast and control your diet. It's because I've had a surprise announcement for a wedding scheduled for 2 months and I've gained a lot of weight and to ""fit"" into the clothes I need to lose 30ish kilos. now my hopes are in 2 months I reach this and maybe lose more but seems doubtful therefore I'm aiming for the most while being able to maintain a normal life.

We were in love for a very short time and then she had no one to support her. She was filing for a police arrest on the abuser and I was there during all the trials and hearings, through all the nights of her weeping over him. And after few months when she felt better . She said she wants to be friends. I tried so hard to make her love me again . Begged and pleaded. Cried and drank for days , I was the exact opposite of what her ex was and still I got dumped and blocked. 
The last words which broke me the most was “ I’d date anyone except you and I don’t want to be friends because I’ve moved on” 
This was not even after a month. 
I still can’t believe that I got used and feel like absolute garbage. I gave all my love to her, All my time avoiding my friends with her because she didn’t have many. 

But now I am slowly learning that I can never really believe in love or trust anyone. Slowly picking myself day by day . Oftentimes I just sit and wonder what did I do wrong and question my self worth. But anyways I am loving myself more than ever. 

What I’ve learnt is Put your self respect and treat yourself with the same kindness you treated them. Use this as a lesson on what to see when you truly find the one you will like.

And I’m ready to be patient and give her time and space to heal as I truly believe that she is the one for me not just because she is kind and compassionate but because she made me feel special and I fell for her instantly . We kissed the same night I met her and she for some reason told me everything about what she had gone through the same night .
I want to be in her life and be there for her and help her fix her broken heart because deep down I know she has something for me and I don’t want to walk away because of something I want now , I want to make her believe that true love does exist and I don’t want to leave .
I want her to heal and see how beautiful the world can be . She has felt so scared to fall again as I can understand how difficult it is to picture all the future with someone and then they abuse you and break you . It changes you .
I feel deep down I have a future with her and it’s been 4 months since I’ve known her and I know everything about her . I want her to see me for the genuine love and affection I can give her because I truly love her.

Unfortunately my application for CS was rejected, though my application for ECE was approved. I am really worried and stressed that because the ECE degree is more hardware-focused than math+statistics like CS, it would significantly limit my career opportunities as a data scientist moving forward.

I have tried most of the basic side hustles, affiliate marketing, print-on-demand, dropshipping, flipping etc. I've even tried some weird ones like fiver (me being the one with skills) and outsourcing (me just marketing other peoples skills). The issue is I haven't really made any decent money besides a few dollars on redbubble which I can't withdraw until December because I am a few dollars below minimum payout. I live in a low cost of living country especially since I don't have to deal with rent as I am still a junior college student (Computer Engineering if thats relevant), so 100$ is pretty decent especially if its scaleable. Heres a rundown of what happened with some of the side hustles I have done that I can currently remember.

Affiliate Marketing: Made 4$ advertising ebay links to people on classified sites. (can't withdraw until they're 10$). Other than that without some market of people, a website, or just outright lying to people, this is a pretty tough and saturated side hustle.

POD: Redbubble about 15$ and feels a bit lucky since a lot of the items bought were expensive netting me a higher amount then expected. (Took a year and 200 designs).

Fiverr: Basically no clicks super low impressions for a multitude of gigs involving computers and graphic design

Outsourcing: Just started this. Talked to some suppliers on fiverr made sure they're okay with me selling their services for a higher price, went on facebook groups and let them know that I can do those services for them, so far no messages, but a very small amount of sales would get me to 100$ so I insisted (to myself lol) that I had to try it.

Flipping: ""Try"" is a strong word I ""looked into"" flipping, but dealing with the weirdos in my country that use seller websites isn't exactly a good idea in my opinion and even if it was considering the value of our currency, 100$ would be very hard to achieve.

Dropshipping: Did a lot of research and decided dealing with shoify is saturated especially with low start up money. I'm aiming to at some point this year find a good supplier and resell on ebay instead.

Instagram page: Overall I'd say this one was a big learning experience filled with just mistakes. I ran two instagram accounts and pushed one to 2.2k and one to about 6.6k. The 2.2k was completely dead in the sense that not only could I have never made any money with it, but also I had to put in so much effort to make it work. The 6.6k one was easier to grow but I was so concerned with maintaining likes and engagement that the majority of my followers were from third world countries and I didn't really worry about it. Eventually I completely burned out probably about 1 year or so in.

Surveys: I'm embarrassed to even put this here, mostly put it so nobody recommends it. Not only is it slave labor, but also it just doesn't work very well given my country, age, and income (0$). I never got recommended surveys assuming it was even available here.

Overall as someone who hated dealing with people, the side hustles I tried helped a lot with that, but I never made any money and its extremely demotivating when you consider the countless hours I spent learning, reciprocating, and even twisting methods, so it would be nice to find a side hustle that has a good success rate even if it is going to net me ""only"" 100$ a month.

Extra notes: A lot of the typical work you would find being done by teenagers / young adults are done by adults at a very cheap rate here; for example, in my area lawns are mowed by a 50 year oldish man and his son for about 5$.

When people make original suggestions, I add to it.  It works for me.  (Note:  I have no major health issues, and I regularly camp and backpack, so I may not list items that you feel need to be added.)

&#x200B;

\*) If it can hold an electrical charge, charge it.  Charge any rechargeable batteries. I'd also do laptops, cell phones, and lawn mower and boat batteries in case you can figure out a way to use that energy. Charge all portable power tools

\*) Empty all large trash cans and recycling bins and fill with water. (This prevents them from flying around, and you can use the water for flushing toilets and other 'non-drinkable' needs.)

\*) Fill the bathtub.  If you don't have a great seal, put saran wrap over the plug and cover with a bowl.

\*) Fill all propane cylinders.

\*) Verify that you have candles, and lamp oil. Citronella oil can often prove very helpful.

\*) Make sure any supplies of necessary prescriptions are at least a week ahead.

\*) Remove and store any hanging potential projectiles like bird feeders and wind chimes.

\*) Make sure you have rolls of heavy grade plastic, plenty of nails, preferably some plywood, and duct tape.

\*) Make sure your chainsaw is in good shape, with extra bar oil, fuel mix, and extra blades.  Sharpen axes if you have time; locate any logging chains, tow cables, or winches.

\*) Gasoline in jerry cans. If you don't need it, you can fill up your car with it after the hurricane's over.

\*) Top off all cars

\*) Local PAPER maps as backups.

\*) Fill whatever containers you have with water. I always keep a garbage bag with old recyclable ones in the attic. A gallon a day per person.

\*) Stow patio furniture.

\*) At least $400-$500 in cash. Remember, no ATMs or credit card readers will work until electricity returns.

\*) If you're leaving town, be sure to turn off water, electricity and gas AT THE SOURCE for the house.

\*) Test your generator.  EDIT: Change the oil if necessary.  If you just bought one, test it and familiarize yourself with operations.

\*) Take any plastic containers, starting with the largest, fill with water, and put them in your freezers.  The idea is fill the empty spaces in your freezer with ice, which gives you way more ice, and way less air to exchange when you open the doors. EDIT: Freezer packs have better thermal mass, although you can't drink them.

\*) If flooding is an issue, put photograph albums, etc., into large plastic containers.

\*) Run the dishwashers, clothes washers, etc., as much as possible.

\*) If it's perishable meat, either go ahead and cook it, or prepare to BBQ like you've never barbecued before.

\*) Put a coin on top of a cup of water in the freezer.  If power goes out for awhile, the depth the coin sinks into the water before refreezing tells you how much damage occurred to frozen goods.

\*) Get caught up on laundry and dishes before it hits.  EDIT: Shampoo, etc., beforehand as well.

\*) EDIT: A weather radio is good.

\*) EDIT: Remember food and litter for your pets.

One article I read described salting both sides vigorously and leaving the meat open to air in the fridge for one to three days.

Anyway, so two days ago I cut off about a two-pound slab for dinner, salted both sides vigorously with montreal steak seasoning, and left it open on a rack in the fridge.    I want to cook it tonight.

Would marinating it for a few hours while it rooms up to room temperature make it better, or worse?

How would such an unlikely combination occur?  Well, last date night, we decided to skip Vin Rouge, Harvest 18, and some of our other favorites and pursue this mystery.  EDIT:  It is called ""Crab Sea"".

It's in the somewhat ""down-market"" Parkwood shopping center.  (I say ""down-market"" as the anchor store is a Big Lots, and there was a guy selling rims out of his trunk in the parking lot.)  Anyway, we walk in, and are struck by the decor:   lots of nautical things like ship's wheels and nets on the walls, a few chinese language posters, and....a big fake Christmas tree.  There were also Christmas lights, a stuffed reindeer, and a Christmas-themed Harley Davidson figurine.   There are two TVs:  one with the sound turned off with an aquarium being displayed, and one blasting generic international EDM.     There are giant fiberglass lobsters and crabs arrayed around the place.  There's also a six-foot pirate statute that looks like a generic ""Jack Sparrow"".   The waitress has an unplaceable accent, and escorts us to our table.  The place is entirely empty of customers.   When we get our menu we find there is indeed Cajun seafood boils, Chinese cuisine, and....wings.  It's a wing place too.   So I have a super-sweet ice tea, and my wife gets a Corona, and we order.  The waitress sets our table with styrofoam plates, plastic cutlery, and a basket of sauce packets.   The whole time we're there, only one other group comes in, and gets a giant clear plastic bag of what seems like mostly crab legs.   Another dozen or so people come in and out, some getting take-out.    We get our food, served in styrofoam take-away containers.   The lemon-wings my wife got were actually pretty good.  The Kung Pao chicken was kinda bland and didn't have peanuts in it, which I always thought was required, so I'll rate it as ""food court grade"".     Anyway, the waitress was friendly, the service was quick, it was cheap, and the bizarre decor is certainly entertaining.  We were trying to discreetly photograph ourselves with one of the giant fiberglass crustaceans, and one of the cooks came out and took our phone, insisting on taking the photo so we could both be in it.

OK, up front, I'm an old coot.  When I grew up scouting, you got the standard 2D-cell aluminum tube flashlight.  It was about as good as a candle, although, mercifully, wind-proof.  If you wanted to get serious, you could get a 6 Volt -- which was a big bigger than a house brick, and about as heavy.  Or you could get a cop flashlight -- which would be a half-dozen D-cells in a long tube, beloved by cops because if a perp jumped you, you were carrying something that had the characteristics of a steel pipe crossed with a baseball bat.  They weighed about as much as a rifle, but gave out pretty good light, if you kept chucking D-cells in them.

I spent a decade or so as a cub scout leader when my kids were small, and I never bought any good flashlights, just the stuff like you get by the cash register at the Home Depot.  Why?  Because some kid would borrow it, lose it, and five minutes later ask to borrow your backup light.   I wasn't buying a thirty dollar flashlight and losing sleep over it.

Now, my youngest is 15, I'm only doing high adventure stuff with older, more responsible kids, and I decided to treat myself.  I got the complete set from Coast (not trying to advertise here, just a happy customer), of the large one (it's an internal battery, but about 3 AA's), the ""pen"" model which a  single AA, and a headlamp. The amount of lumens and battery life that comes out of one of these is at least an order of magnitude higher than what we had back in the day.

Forecasting is not an area of data science I know well at all, so forgive my clumsy explanation here.

The domain is to forecast expected load in a logistics network given previous year's data.   For example, given the last five years of data, how many pounds of air freight can I expect to move between Indianapolis and Memphis on December 3rd?  (Repeat for every ""lane"" (combination of cities) for six months).    There are multiple cyclical factors here (day-of-week, day of month, the holidays, etc).   There is also an expectation that there will be year-to-year growth or decline.    This comprises a messy problem you could handle with TBATS or ARIMA, given a fast computer and the expectation it's going to run all day.

Here's the additional complication.   Freight can move either by air or surface.   There's a table that specifies for each ""lane"" (pair of cities), and date what the preferred transport mode (air|surface) is.   Those tables change year-to-year, and management is trying to move more by surface this year to cut costs.  Further complicating the problem is that local management sometimes behaves ""opportunistically"" -- if a plane intended for ""priority"" freight is going to leave partially full, they might fill the space left open by ""priority"" freight with ""regular"" freight.

The current problem solving approach is to just use a ""growth factor"" -- if there's generally +5% more this year, multiply the same-period-last-year (SPLY) data by 1.05.  Then people go in manually, and adjust for things like plant closures.   This produces horrendous errors.   I've redone the model using TBATS, ignoring the preferred transport information, and it produces a gruesomely inaccurate projection that's only good if I compare it to the ""growth factor"" approach I described.  That model takes about 18 hours to run on the best machine I can put my hands on, doing a bunch of fancy stuff to spread the load out over 20 cores.

I don't even know where to start.  My reading on TBATS, ARIMA, and exponential smoothing lead me to believe I can't use any kind of categorical data.  Can somebody recommend a forecasting approach that can take SPLY data, categorical data that suggests how the freight should be moving, and is both poly-cyclical and has growth?    I'm not asking you to solve this for me, but I don't even know where to start reading.  I'm good at R (the current model is implemented there), ok at Python, and have access to a SAS Viya installation running on a pretty beefy infrastructure.

I  was playing this weekend, and decided to try playing a blues song in D  by open-tuning my guitar and getting a bottleneck slide out.  (I'd  smashed a finger on my left hand between a wrench and a cinderblock  wall, and I wasn't about to let that ruin my playing time over a long  weekend!)

Anyway, I didn't have  any reference stuff at hand, and just winged it, and it occurs to me  that there's a LOT of different ways to open tune a guitar in a given  key.  For example, in open G tuning, the standard way to do it is  DGDGBD.  (Keith Richards used to remove the base string, so he used  xGDGBD, and if there's an expert on open-G tuning, I would say it's  him).   I've seen one Pink Floyd song where they uptuned the bass string  to G, so you get GGDGBD, which gives you a pretty intense drone).   Using Open-G as an example, I figure that five of the strings could be  tuned to two different notes in the chord, keeping within 3 semitones,  so you could get any combination of (G,D)x(B,G)x(D,B)x(G)x(B,D)x(D,G),  for 32 possible combinations.

From  what I've seen, the general rules are that (1) You tend to down-tune,  rather than up-tune, (2) Three semitones either way seems to be about  the limit before you break strings or it starts sounding weird, and (3)  You want more Roots than Fifths, and more Fifths than Thirds.

What  do you folks think? Is there a reason why you only see certain  combinations?  I think there are some that would sound pretty dorky (for  example, in my open G example, you could do it as DBBGBG, which I don't  think would sound good).

Why are some combinations regarded as the best?  Anybody got some physics or music theory explanations?

I'm envisioning a  one-off situation, like a hypothermia case or needing to make a signaling fire.

Here's what I eventually invented.   Save up your dryer lint for a few weeks.  Stuff it in a bag, add a few smears of vaseline, and microwave it so the vaseline spreads out and soaks in.  Then get some of those tiny paper cups, the little ones, like they give you mouthwash in at the dentist, or for wine samples.  Put in a half inch of the lint, cover the lint with a piece of wax paper on top, and then pour in some melted candle wax.   Let it harden, trim off the excess paper.  You then have a little disk like a hockey puck sealed in wax.  That can probably be lit as is with a hurricane match or a lighter, or you can break it open to expose the lint if you need to use flint&steel, a magnifying glass, or one of the other desperate measures.  I've got them in the first aid kit inside a ziplock that contains a mini-Bic and a half dozen hurricane matches.

So, there you go.  Waterproof, burns like mad for several minutes, and as close to foolproof as I can figure.  I made a dozen or so, and I'm going camping up on the New River this weekend, and will take a couple to test.

We've spotted some great deals, arranged a meeting, and it ends up being at places in these small business parks where you find random places like painting businesses and accountants, and it's little store fronts with no labeling.   The people inside were all West Africans, I think Nigerians from the accent.   The cars always have some minor red flags -- they were just retitled after ""very minor"" accidents, dashboard lights coming on that ""are no big deal"".  At the last car we looked at was just an excellent deal for a pristine Altima, and we told the guy we'd take it, pending a thumbs-up from our mechanic.  The guy flat out refused, saying we would be running up the mileage and ruining the resale value.   I mean....what the hell?  I've never had somebody refuse that request on a serious purchase.     He compromised with us taking it to a mechanic he specified down the street, and we walked on the deal.   (We checked the trunk for the spare, and found scattered automotive glass and a puddle of water under the spare, which is also kind of....what the hell?)

I use vi mode and `fzf` in my terminal. `fzf` binds `fzf-completion` to tab by default. I want to reassign `fzf-completion` to a different keybinding, and use the tab key for something else.

# The problem

The tab key remains mapped to `fzf-completion`, despite overriding it in my .zshrc.

# The details

My understanding is that upon login, the following files are automatically sourced in this order:

1. .zshenv
2. .zprofile
2. .zshrc 
3. .zlogin

I don’t have a .zprofile or a .zlogin.

My .zshrc runs `source .fzf.zsh` which sets the `fzf` keybindings. I have confirmed that prior to this line, tab is not bound to `fzf-completion`, and afterwards it is.

To bring about the behaviors I wanted, I added the following at the very end of my .zshrc:

    # remove tab keymap (should be fzf-completion)
    bindkey -r ""^I""

    # map new thing to tab in insert mode
    bindkey -M viins ""^I"" <something_else>

    # map new thing to tab in command mode
    bindkey -M vicmd ""^I"" <something_else>

    # map new thing shift-tab to fzf-completion in insert mode
    bindkey -M viins ""^[[Z"" fzf-completion

    # map new thing shift-tab to fzf-completion in command mode
    bindkey -M vicmd ""^[[Z"" fzf-completion

(I think the `-r` part is unnecessary/redundant, because a key can only support one keybinding, so assigning a new action to the same key should effectively destroy the original keybinding. But I did it anyway…)

I have confirmed that right after these lines run, the desired keys are mapped to the desired behaviors. I confirmed this by adding `bindkey` afterward to show the actual mapping.

But bizarrely, after my shell is finished loading all the rcs and other configs and stuff, tab is mapped to `fzf-completion` again! I have no idea how this might be, since AFAIK `.fzf.zsh` is only sourced in one place (.zshrc), and I confirmed at the end of that file that tab is no longer mapped to `fzf-completion`!

But as I consider finding my second DS* position, this backstory presents a slight dilemma.

I just updated my CV, cutting out *everything* that's not relevant to DS, except for my undergrad and grad degrees. In its place, under ""*Recent* Work Experience"" I went all out listing absolutely every little thing I have done since 2019. But then I realized that this leaves a huge chunk of time unaccounted for on my CV. Someone who looks at it might think ""Great, this guy meets DS requirements X Y and Z - but damn, what was he in prison for a while or something?"" Lol. There's just no way for them to know what I spent the years between school and 2019 doing, based only on the info in this DS CV.

My rationale for cutting so much was obviously the concern that it would add nothing to the strength of my application, and perhaps even make it weaker. I also *really* want to stay away from the field of education... But now I'm questioning this decision, and wondering if there is still some merit to mentioning - even if only briefly - all the other stuff I've done. If for no other reason than to show that I have in fact been gainfully employed for my entire adult life.

With the large number of people who have entered DS later in life or through non-traditional routes, surely I'm not the only person who has faced this. What are your thoughts? What have you seen?

\* Technically my field is ML engineering, not stats or DS proper. But there is obviously huge cross-over between all these, and anyway this detail is irrelevant to my question, so I'm not splitting hairs.

**Edit: Important clarification -** It wasn't like I moved from pumping gas into DS. The jump wasn't *that* extreme. Rather, pre-2019 I was working in language education, and now I work in NLP. So interest in language is the common thread. It's just that my previous work had nothing to do with coding, math, stats, data, or anything remotely DS-like. Although the domain has always been language, the minimum viable skill sets for my pre- and post-2019 work are completely non-intersecting.

**Edit: Less important -** “Education” here does not mean “teaching”. Sorry for the confusion.

My child is of the age (~5) where he’s started to ask lots of questions that defy one-sentence answers to properly explain. For example, of a scientific nature. I absolutely love it, but am not convinced I’m explaining things in the best, most appropriate way for a young child. I’m curious how others do it.

Here’s my technique:

First I get on his level, starting by establishing things about the world that he already understands. Then I try to build off that, one step at a time, but I find this sometimes leads me to over-explain, providing maybe more detail than is necessary or even helpful in order to help him “really get it”. Is that bad?

Case in point: Yesterday around 4PM we were in the car, when he said something that clearly indicated he thought it was still the morning. I told him it was actually the afternoon and his mind was blown, not really understanding how that could be. It occurred to me that he may not really understand the difference between morning and afternoon, because he doesn’t have a great grasp of time. So at first I tried to keep it simple: “After you have lunch, it’s the afternoon.” But then he found the flaw in that: “So if you skip lunch, is it morning all day?” Hm… So I just decided to give him the full answer. First I started with what he knows: numbers. “You know that clock in your room? You know how sometimes it has an 8 on it, or a 9, or a 10? Well, those are times of the day. And when your clock says 12, that’s a special time because it’s when the morning ends. It’s so special that it has its own name: ‘noon’. So once it’s after 12, it’s ‘after noon’. Get it?” He seemed to, but like, that felt like quite a journey to get there, and I’m not sure he always does. Then to take things full circle, I pointed out that 12 o'clock is around when people eat lunch, hence my original explanation.

My explanations almost always go that way: building up from first principles/common ground, one step at a time, to arrive at the desired eureka moment. I believe that is the best way to explain complex ideas to an adult, but I’m not sure for a child.

I'd like the reader to walk away with a sense of how much each feature contributes to model performance, relative to a baseline of no non-text features. Ideas?

**Third, I'm wondering if the graph type linked in my initial paragraph is one way to visualize my study's results.** As I worked with four different features, I was thinking I could have one axis per feature. Then I could simply group the performance of all my models by feature, take the mean performance across all models that use each feature, then just plot those means (I don't think normalization would achieve anything as all axes would already be on the same scale). The math of this proposal would look like this (assuming only 3 features for simplicity, and thus a 3-axis visualization, though the concept is the same):

&#x200B;

||feature 1|feature 3|feature 3|performance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|model 1|✓|✓|✓|0.8|
|model 2|✓|✓||0.5|
|model 3|✓||✓|0.7|
|model 4||✓|✓|0.6|
|model 5|✓|||0.2|
|model 6||✓||0.4|
|model 7|||✓|0.1|

&#x200B;

|feature|mean performance|
|:-|:-|
|feature 1|(0.8 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.2) / 4 = **0.550**|
|feature 2|(0.8 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.4) / 4 = **0.575**|
|feature 3|(0.8 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.3) / 4 = **0.600**|

So the numbers in the final column of the final table are what would be plotted. These would determine how ""pointy"" the polygon is in each axis.

Is that math defensible, and would the resultant visualization effectively communicate the relative contributions of each feature to the performance of my model?

So far I consider myself a moderate success story: With zero relevant education or experience, in my 30s I taught myself math, stats, and coding, then scored a job as a junior machine learning research engineer. In this job I analyze large data sets, run deep learning experiments in the cloud using large pre-trained models, and write back end code to serve these models for inference in operational products. My work is a mixture of ML research and MLOps. I’ve trained thousands of models, written tens (maybe low hundreds?) of thousands of lines of code, and even been listed on a couple papers and one patent. As a junior engineer I’m mostly told what to do, but I have significant freedom to decide how best to do it. This was exactly my goal when I first embarked on my improbable journey.

I’ve been in this role for 2.5 years now. I’ve learned so much and really loved it. But lately the sheen has worn off, and dissatisfaction has started to creep in. Basically I just need more money to support my family, and this job isn’t going to deliver it fast enough.

So now I feel significant pressure to find my second MLE job, but everything about that prospect terrifies me. My current job is all I’ve ever known in tech, and I’m just not experienced enough to get a feel for how competitive I’ll be in the market. I still feel weak compared to many colleagues, but maybe it’s just imposter syndrome. Also, my ML subfield (NLP) is moving so fast these days that the moment you learn something new it’s already out of date, making it impossible to ascertain how comprehensive or current my skill set actually is. So I just really don’t know.

Anyway, here is a grab bag of my skills and credentials, I guess:

- Education

    - Two MA degrees, one marginally relevant to NLP but not STEM/computational at all, so probably won’t wow any engineering managers

- Python

    - Very proficient

    - Have written tons of it, including packages, but almost all is internal/proprietary

    - Familiar with most of the basic ML/data analysis libraries, and some familiarity with deep learning libraries like PyTorch and transformers (never used TensorFlow)

- Linux

    - Fairly proficient

    - I use Bash and zsh everyday, both locally and on remote servers over ssh, writing and reading shell scripts with low-to-moderate complexity 
- SQL

    - Basic proficiency

    - I can compose simple SQL queries, and some moderately complex ones with Google’s help, but that’s about it. Not doing much with DBs these days.

- Software development

    - Fair amount of experience for 2.5 years, I think

    - I’ve worked with teams of other engineers and PhDs to to write the back ends of our ML-driven engines and software packages

    - I work every day with Git, CI/CD, testing, conda, and OOP, basically all in Python

    - We use the Agile framework. I fucking hate it, but anyway, I know the concepts and lingo

- AWS

    - Not certified, but familiar with the basic concepts and services. Never used any other cloud provider

    - We do most of our experimentation on S3-backed EC2, but are starting to use the SageMaker ecosystem now

- Math/stats

    - Strong enough algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and statistics to understand deep learning techniques and read the occasional research paper

    - No classes or grades or anything to prove this though. I just used Khan Academy for everything, so there’s no real paper trail

Beyond the above, I have started (though not finished) a handful of pet projects on GitHub and completed an absolute assload of MOOCs (I think I have like 26 Coursera certificates).

Things I’m still weak on include:

- Networking

    - As someone with a non-CS, non-STEM background, I have very few connections in the tech industry. Basically my network consists of my current coworkers and a few ex-coworkers who recently left

- Front end

    - Never built a website, dashboard, or GUI of any kind. If someone asked me to surface the outputs of a model to users, I’d have almost no idea where to begin. I could probably figure it out, but it’s not something I can currently

    - For this reason I feel as far from full-stack as one can be

- Data structures and algorithms

    - This is something I never directly studied, but rather have just picked up the very basics as needed on the job. As such my knowledge is superficial, patchy, and incomplete at best

    - I basically understand Big-O and the basic data structures. It’s been sufficient for my current job, but that’s it

    - Have never done any LeetCode or similar

I’m shooting for near-100% test coverage. But there’s one thorny case that has me scratching my head.

Say the class looks like this:

    class Class:

        def method_1(self, a):
            ...
            return result

        def method_2(self, b):
            ...
            return result

        def method_3(self, c):
            ...
            return result

        def main_method(self, a):
            b = self.method_1(a)
            c = self.method_2(b)
            result = self.method_3(c)
            return result

So methods 1, 2, and 3 are all completely independent. As such, they can be isolated and tested independently.

But `main_method` is different: All it does is call the other three methods in a chain and return their final result with no side effects. So to test `main_method` without any mocking, you’re implicitly testing methods 1-3 as well, since all four methods would run during the test. If the test fails then, the bug could be in any of those places. Further, since `main_method` simply returns `method_3`’s return value, any test that simply verifies `main_method` returns the correct thing will be almost analogous to the test for `method_3`.

How does one write tests for a method like this? The best I can think of is to patch methods 1-3 and simply assert that they got called. But that seems pretty hacky/unsophisticated, and the issue of checking `main_method`’s return value being redundant with checking `method_3`’s return value remains unresolved.

Any input appreciated. Thanks!

            return baz

**My goal is to write a test for `MyClass.method`.**

All that method does is call other functions/methods. Those functions/methods already have their own tests. So to test only `MyClass.method` with no confounding side effects, I'd like to simply mock all the objects that get called inside its body, and test only that those objects are called as expected.

**But to do this properly with maximum control, I'll need to mock the return values for each object. Given that the entire `module_to_import.py` is imported, rather than its functions individually, I'm not quite sure how to do this...**

If the functions were imported individually, ...

    # module_to_test.py

            bar = function_1(foo)
            baz = function_2(bar)
            return baz

...then it would be as simple as patching them directly from within the namespace of `module_to_test`...

    from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

    class TestMyClass:

        def test_method(self):
            mock_function_1_retval = 'bar'
            mock_function_2_retval = 'baz'
            with (
                patch('module_to_test.function_1', return_value=mock_function_1_retval) as mock_function_1,
                patch('module_to_test.function_2', return_value=mock_function_2_retval) as mock_function_2
            ):
                baz = my_class.method()
            mock_function_1.assert_called_once_with('foo')
            mock_function_2.assert_called_once_with('bar')

But as things are, to access `function_1` and `function_2`, I have to do so through their shared namespace `module_to_test.module_to_import`, e.g.

    from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

    class TestMyClass:

        def test_method(self):
            with patch('module_to_test.module_to_import') as mock_module_to_import:

            # somehow assert `mock_module_to_import.function_2` called with `'bar'`

 In that case, I'm unsure how to give the functions different return values.

These are effectively properties that are undefined until referenced, then cached. In practice, this means the computation required to define these attributes is performed only once and only on demand, ensuring only the minimal computation required for the task at hand is performed.

Unsure how to implement this behavior, I hit up Stack Overflow, and found the following which seems to do what I want:

    from functools import update_wrapper

    class lazy_property:

        def __init__(self, fget):
            self.fget = fget
            update_wrapper(self, fget)

            value = self.fget(obj)
            setattr(obj, self.fget.__name__, value)
            return value

It can be used like this:

    class SomeClass:

        @lazy_property
        def some_attribute(self):
            ...

The `some_attribute` attribute of all `SomeClass` instances will now be evaluated lazily and only once. Great!

Thing is, I don't understand at all how this works. If instead there were something like

    if self.__dict__.get('some_attribute') is None:
        self.__dict__['some_attribute'] = expensive_computation()

    return self.__dict__['some_attribute']

that would be explicit and straightforward to me. But with all this `obj`, `fget`, and `value` business, plus `cls` which for some reason isn't even referenced, I don't really understand what I'm looking out.

1. Instance attributes should be lazily evaluated wherever possible, not evaluated until referenced. Otherwise, because many attributes are expensive to compute, loading a project could take ages if everything gets assigned at instantiation.

2. Attributes should be “recursive”, with objects able to reference each other via chaining. So like, something like the following should work:

from typing import List

    class Employee:
        …

    class Manager(Employee):
        intern: Intern

    class Intern(Employee):

    intern.manager.intern is intern  # True

I have already written significant code that works exactly like this. But I’m finding that the objects in this code are horrendously coupled. I’m afraid unit testing will be a nightmare and require an absurd degree of mocking.

I just didn’t see any way around it. It’s because of the lazy evaluation, attributes could theoretically be accessed in any order. So objects must be flexible in how they define their attributes, without knowing beforehand which other attributes will have been defined. Exhaustively testing every possibility would require almost 1000 unit tests, I counted.

Anyway, I designed my classes like a cyclic graph, where you start with a `project` object as the central node, and every other object you can create takes the `project` as an attribute, before itself becoming an attribute of the `project`. Thus, you can do `x.project.y.project.x`, where `x` and `y` could be basically any two objects in your project. The chains can get pretty long and sophisticated too.

A good number of these will need one additional subclass. Because these subclasses will be nearly identical yet their immediate parent classes may be different, I’d rather not actually code them up. Instead, I’m mulling over some way to create them dynamically using a single object. Is a metaclass the right tool?

Here’s a stripped down version of the project.

    AbstractClassA
        BaseClassB(A)
            ConcreteClass1(B)
            ConcreteClass2(B)
        BaseClassC(A)
            ConcreteClass3(C)
            ConcreteClass4(C)

At their core, the concrete classes are just fancy wrappers around a Python list. I want them all to have a `sample` method which returns some subset of their lists. But **I want the returned value to be an instance of a new class, a subclass of the associated parent concrete class.** So `ConcreteClass1` would return a `ConcreteClass1Sample`, `ConcreteClass2` would return a `ConcreteClass2Sample`, etc. **Ostensibly only the names of these `*Sample` subclasses will be different.**

So my proposal is to create one metaclass, `GenericSampler` or something, specifically to build these `*Sample` subclasses. It would be invoked inside a concrete class’ `sample` method, and take that concrete class instance as input somehow, before returning an associated `Sample` class as a subclass of the concrete class. Finally, the `sample` method returns the subclass.

Does this make any sense? I’ve read a fair amount about metaclasses, but I’ve just never seen the point. However, [this SO reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/392160/what-are-some-concrete-use-cases-for-metaclasses#:~:text=Having%20considered%20the%20most%20common,or%20function%20can%20unbake%20them.) says one of the few times you *need* to use a metaclass is when you don’t want to hardcode a class' name in advance, and my proposal has exactly that problem.

Curious for your thoughts.

So I’ll describe the problem, then lead into the post title, knowing that it may all be moot in the end.

I have a dataclass whose init takes an iterable as an argument. I’d like that iterable’s `len` to show up in the class’s repr as `size`. But because the size of the iterable can change, the `size` attribute will have to update dynamically. I don’t know how to make the attributes in a dataclass repr update dynamically like this. That is my problem statement.

I like the default dataclass repr format (i.e., `ClassName(attr1_name=attr1_value, …)`), and want to avoid reinventing it as much as possible. To that end, I’m wondering if I can keep `size` out of the default repr, then access that repr as a string, then add `size` using string method, then return the result as the “real” repr. Something like this:

    from dataclasses import dataclass, field

    @dataclass
    class Foo:

        some_attr: int
        iterable: Iterable[int] = field(repr=False)

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            dataclass_repr_str = super().__repr__()
            return dataclass_repr_str[:-1] + f', size={self.size})'

        @property
        def size(self) -> int:
            return len(self.iterable)

Obviously that code won’t work at all, at a minimum because `super` won’t refer to `dataclass`. But hopefully it illustrates my thinking: get the dataclass repr as a string, then add the `size` property to it in the typical dataclass repr format.

I use them to separate objects in the global scope, of course. Function and class definitions, constants, and the import sections. Also to separate logical chunks.

But I also do it kind of arbitrarily. Like to separate `import x` and `from x import y`statements. Or sometimes I’ll put a line between say a counter and its loop, vs putting them together, e.g,

    counter = 0
    while condition is True:
        …
        counter += 1

    # vs

I have a 65"" flatscreen TV I'd like to mount on my wall. The TV and wall are pictured here:

https://imgur.com/a/Wf66qia

Eye level from the couch is the center of that photo. This post is to seek ideas on how best to mount the TV on this wall.

The obvious position is to position the TV's center at eye level. The problem is that the wall has wainscoting around the middle which protrudes about 1.5"" and would interfere with the mount. Considering that, I see only three options for how to mount it, all bad:

1. **Cut a TV-width section of the wainscoting off the wall, then just mount at eye level.** This would put the TV at the optimal height, but might be kinda ugly with the TV seemingly obscuring the wainscoting, and it would also permanently ruin the wainscoting should I ever want to remove the TV.

2. **Mount the TV somewhere above the wainscoting, such as centered between the wainscoting and the 9-ft ceiling, or with its bottom edge 6-8"" above the wainscoting.** This might be the prettiest, most aesthetically balanced placement, but it's also way too high to watch comfortably. This could perhaps be offset by using a mount that can come out and down when I want to watch, bringing the TV to near eye level. But it'd be a pain to have to do this every time, and also those mounts are quite expensive.

3. **Mount the TV so its bottom edge is flush with the top of the wainscoting.** This is a middle-of-the-road approach which mitigates the drawbacks of Options 1 and 2: no expensive fancy mount, TV center only a bit above eye level, no damage to wainscoting. However, the height is still not ideal IMHO, and I'm afraid it would look ugly to have the TV essentially resting right on the wainscoting.

Absent any input, my preferences would be options 3 > 2 > 1. But I dunno, I'm just so meh on all of these options that I can't decide. It's also possible that there's a fourth option I haven't even considered.

So it seems like while my project languished, my credentials also lapsed...?

But that can't be correct, because I can currently push/pull from other repos, and isn't authentication global to your entire machine, instead of individual repos?

After doing that, the error went away.

But that is not really viable for the big project I'm asking about. The amount of unpushed branches and commits is quite substantial. I'd be really wary of losing anything.

So what can I do? Is there some ""flip"" I can ""just switch"" to re-authenticate the existing clone? Or is there some straightforward, guaranteed way to transfer my local history to a brand new clone whose authentication is valid?

My solution was in the top 95% most efficient, which I guess is good? Essentially it leverages a sorted stack. Here it is, in Python:

    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            while len(stones) > 1:
                stones.sort()
                y = stones.pop()
                x = stones.pop()
                z = y - x
                if z > 0:
                    stones.append(z)
            return stones[0] if stones else 0

I have no idea how to analyze the time complexity here, however. I'd really like to know how to reason about this.

On each iteration...
- the list is sorted
- two ""stones"" are removed and the lighter one is subtracted from the heavier one
- if the result `z` is nonzero, it is added back into the list

In the best case, `z` is zero, meaning the list shrinks by two values. In the worst case, the result is nonzero, so the list only shrinks by one value. So for just the shrinking bit, I think the best case complexity is O(N/2) and the worst case is O(N). Constants don't matter, so let's just take O(N).

But then there's also the sorting bit. [According to GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-in-python/#:~:text=Its%20time%20complexity%20is%20O(NlogN)), `list.sort` has a complexity of O(N logN). This occurs on every iteration.

So what is the overall complexity of this algorithm? Would it be like O(N^2 logN), because O(N) * O(N logN)? Is that even a thing?

I understand the textbook examples you always read about, such as a nested for loop == O(N^(2)). But in this more complex example where there are multiple pieces at play, I just can't wrap my brain around the big picture.

With no flags passed, `grep <pattern> <filenames>` returns every line across all files in `<filepath>` that contains the substring `<pattern>`.

With `-l` passed, `grep -l <pattern> <filenames>` returns the subset of `<filenames>` (so, filepaths) which contain the substring in them, not the actual matching lines themselves.

So the real difference is whether you want matching lines (no flags) or matching files (`-l`).

My questions are: (1) How can I represent the time complexity of these two commands in Big O notation, and (2) are their time complexities the same?

My guess is that both commands are O(M * N), where M is the number of files and N is the number of lines per file.

The problem with this is that while M is fixed, N will vary, since the files making up M may have different numbers of lines. I understand that this sort of ""noise"" is kind of ignored in Big O notation, which is simply about limiting behavior.

Say I want a program which takes a nonzero integer and iteratively decrements it, stopping when just before zero.

For example, given the integer 5, I'd want the following output:

    5
    4
    3
    2
    1

Here are two pseudocode algorithms which would solve this problem:

    // algo 1
    n = 5
    i = 0
    while n greater than 0:
        print n
        n = n - 1
        i = i + 1

    // algo 2
    n = 5
    i = 0
    while (n - i) greater than 0:
        print n - i
        i = i + 1

The difference between them is simply whether `n` gets updated, versus just computed as needed on the fly.

I'd like to know the following three things about these two algorithms:

1. What is the **time** complexity of each - is one more efficient?

2. What is the **space** complexity of each - is one more efficient?

3. Which is more efficient in terms of the underlying computation graph, irrespective of time/space complexity?

For (1), my guess is that the time complexity for both is the same, O(n). My reasoning is that although algo 1 has one additional line (i.e., `n = n - 1`), both are simply performing `n` iterations, irrespective of what actually occurs within the loop.

For (2), my guess is that the space complexity for both is O(1). My reasoning is that both only ever require the assignment of two variables, `n` and `i`, regardless of the size of the initial integer. However, algo 1 *does* involve reassigning `n`, and I'm not sure if that affects the space complexity analysis.

For (3) - and it may be that this question doesn't even make sense - my guess is that it really depends on how the various structs are implemented in whatever language you're coding in. In other words, whether it is more efficient to do more math more often and do less variable assignment, versus the inverse, will be a function of how your language is optimized. In general though, I'd assume though that doing a calculation once and assigning the result to a variable for future reference is more efficient than just doing the same calculation multiple times and never storing the result.

Take yesterday at the dinner table. He is usually not a very messy eater, but yesterday he was making a giant mess, with food all over the table and floor; he wasn't really even eating, just playing with his food. I dunno, I guess he was just kinda hyper and thought it was fun/funny. I asked him to stop it several (4-5?) times, but he continued. Then I told him dinner would be over if he didn't stop (of course I'd give him some other sustenance later), but he didn't, so I took away his plate for about 30 seconds until he protested. I asked him again to stop and said this was his last chance, then gave him his plate back. But then he started spitting water while laughing - not to be deliberately bad, but again just because he thought it was funny.

With the lack of eating, the mess I already had to clean up, and the multiple chances I had already given, the water was the last straw. So I snapped. In frustration and in one fell swoop, immediately I took his plate away, semi-aggressively picked him up off his chair, carried him into the bathroom, and began washing his hands and face. The whole time he was screaming and protesting, but I continued to follow through on what I had said would happen. Because he was struggling so much though, for about one full minute I had to get kinda physical to restrain him and impose the rules, i.e., *""dinner is over, wash your hands""*. He was kicking and screaming while I held him over my knee cleaning him off.

A minute later once I felt like the message had finally been received, I pull him down, squatted to his level, and basically said *""I told you this would happen, bla bla, you need to do what I ask, bla bla, are you gonna finish dinner like a good boy?""* He nodded, so we sat back down and I returned his plate to him. Then he finished his meal with no more mess. Right away though I felt bad about how I'd just handled things, but I didn't want to undermine myself by immediately be like ""oops, daddy was wrong"". So rather than seem to continue to be angry, I just started being light and goofy with him trying to make him laugh and help us move on, which worked. By the time he went to bed that night an hour or so later, he had forgotten about it (I hope).

In the end, my snapping DID bring about the desired ends, but were the means justified? Was this swift and semi-physical reaction justified given the context leading up to it? Or was my kid just being a kid, and I should learn to control these outbursts of frustration?

If my reaction WAS reasonable, I'll just need to learn to trust my instincts more and have confidence in my actions, rather than waffling about them.

Always have been. Things that take others 10 minutes will take me 30. I generally struggle to explain why.**

Sometimes I just feel I’m being thorough. Other times I just like to relax and take my time. But most times it just…happens. As I age and have more demands on my time, this tendency towards slowness is becoming a problem, because I no longer have enough time for everything I want or need to.

**I’m mostly talking about totally mundane things here. Some random examples:**

- I’m always the last one to the table at mealtime.

- When grocery shopping, I’ll usually spend the better part of an hour at the store, even for just a handful of items.

- I could easily spend 45 minutes washing the dishes.

- 15 minutes is my minimum shower duration, closer to 30 incl. drying hair etc.

- I have 4 bathrooms in my house, and it takes me several hours to clean them all.

- Mowing my modest lawn takes fully 1.5 hours.

- Making a simple omelet with diced veggies for two will take me half an hour.

- When taking my kid to a playground, I’ll make sure he has an opportunity to play on every piece of equipment at least once, even if we don’t have much time.

- I always take the maximum time allotted to do something, or slightly more. Like if I set a goal of getting out the door by a certain time, I’ll always leave at 5-10 minutes past that.

**I don’t think this is just routine perfectionism (though that’s probably a component), because I don’t feel like doing things more quickly would result in a worse product. Instead, my feeling is that fundamentally, I just have a poor sense for time/durations, and also a poor feel for when enough is enough. It’s just a bunch of very minor inefficiencies that add up to major inefficiency overall.**

Like when exercising, I end up waiting a minute between ~~reps~~ sets when it could be just 20-30 seconds, making the entire workout take a long time. Or when washing a pan I’ll take two quick passes over the lid rim when one would probably suffice. Tendencies like those simply don’t scale.

How can I keep this deeply ingrained tendency in check? It’s one thing to acknowledge it - which I have - but quite another to address it. Especially because any given inefficiency is small, the overall inefficiency sneaks up on me. Yet constantly thinking about it as I e.g., shop for groceries, constantly checking my watch and wondering “Is this taking too long?” feels unnatural, stresses me out and reduces my enjoyment of the little things in life.

# TL;DR

I need help selecting between `spacy` and `sklearn` for processing a huge text corpus. I ran a test to measure the performance of each, but the results were unexpected. Moreover, because I'm new-ish to the frameworks involved, I lack confidence that my test is completely valid. I'd really appreciate some guidance.

# Background

I'm doing a project that involves preprocessing 35 million Reddit comments. This is a pretty massive amount of text. So I'm searching for the most efficient framework to accomplish this with.

Currently, I am considering using either `spacy`’s `nlp.pipe` with several custom components, or a `sklearn.Pipeline` with a ton of regex-based data transformers. Since (1) `spacy` is optimized for text and (2) regex in Python is slow, I figured the `spacy` option is the way to go. But I wanted to test my assumptions before proceeding.

# The test

[So I wrote a quick and dirty script to do just that.](https://pastebin.com/dBAW1rrD) It seems like a lot of code at first skim, but it's actually not. It's very modular, mostly consisting of simple classes. Skip to `if __name__ ...` at the end to see the overall logic.

Anyway, this script defines what I *think* are broadly equivalent pipelines, one `spacy`-based and one `sklearn`-based, that simply remove (1) punctuation and (2) inline code `like this`. These pipelines subclass an additional class which actually carries out the test. So the script loads a ~7.5k-comment sample from this sub as a `dask.dataframe` (for parallelization), applies the same preprocessing 100 times using each pipeline, then averages out the results.

To be clear, my actual pipeline will do several more things than just remove punctuation and inline code. I only chose those for testing purposes, to keep my tests simple and to the point.

# Results

My findings (in seconds) are as follows, illustrated graphically [here](https://imgur.com/a/dhJmNGi):

|:-:|-:|-:|
|`spacy`|13.49772|1.182763|
|`sklearn`|6.853291|0.127701|

Clearly, `spacy` was massively slower. This contradicted my expectations, and leaves me unable to draw firm conclusions.

Is `sklearn.Pipeline` with regex truly the more efficient framework for this? Or was there an issue with my test, or how I structured my pipelines? The latter seems plausible because almost everything the script uses is new-ish to me - `dask.dataframe`, `spacy` with custom components, and `sklearn.Pipeline` with custom transformers. So it may very well be that e.g., I'm just using `spacy` wrong, or there's something about my script that renders the comparison apples to oranges instead of apples to apples.

Now I want to use them to train some classification models. But this volume of data is proving seriously challenging to work with.

My current set up is that the comment strings are stored as a `dask.Series`. At first I was using `dask` methods to clean the comments in parallel (this step involves multiple passes each using regex), then using `apply(nlp)` to convert each comment into a `spacy` `Doc` (this just uses `spacy`’s default preprocessing pipeline). But it takes an absolute eternity, before running out of memory and failing.

So something has to give here, but I’m not sure what. I’ve considered using `numpy` instead of `dask`, but `dask` doesn’t seem like the right tool since it’s really optimized for numerical computation, not string operations.

So how on earth can I preprocess this much natural language data??? Let me know if more details are required.

Edit: Some additional thoughts…

- So far all of this has been done on a standard-issue MacBook Pro, which is very likely just unable to handle this task. Eventually I’d like to move all my computation to AWS EC2, which seems like the right move. But before that point, I’d like to make sure my code is as optimized as possible. I’m not convinced that it’s there yet.

- I have also considered using `spacy`’s `nlp.pipe` to take advantage of multiprocessing, but I’m not sure yet how best to get that working with data stored as a `dask.Series`.

However, when  run the script, I get the following output (too long to paste here):

https://pastebin.com/rSerw72q

You can see two errors: A `ValueError` thrown by `logging` when creating the `conda` env, and then what I think is some `pip` or `distutils` error thrown when installing my package into the env. Also, when the script finishes running (actually, I think technically it doesn't finish because of `set -e` - but I digress), no `.egg-info` file has been created for my package, which I expected to see.

What's going on here? Why isn't the installation working? It used to, but after several weeks of developing the package I reinstalled my entire env and now the same script seems not to work. Is there an issue with my setup, or my dependencies?

Oh and for good measure, here is my package's `setup.py`:

Could the fact that the dependencies are listed in both my `environment.yaml` *and* in my `setup.py` cause a conflict between `conda` and `pip`? Anyway, curious to hear your thoughts.

Edit: I removed the `install_requires` section from my `setup.py` and reran my env-creation script. Now I don't get that `pip`/`distutils` error and I do see the `.egg-info`, so that's progress. But (a) it's not clear to me why I even needed to remove that section, since IIRC it wasn't causing issues before, and (b) anyway I still get the `ValueError` thrown by `logging`. So I'm not convinced that section of my `setup.py` the full story, nor do I have confidence that my env is error-free.",False,False,learnpython,Strange errors when setting up conda env with pip dependencies,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/uoryfj/strange_errors_when_setting_up_conda_env_with_pip/

Not a data engineer, and pretty inexperienced with AWS. So all of this is way outside my wheelhouse.

# Problem statement

I have a lot of data that I will use to train machine learning models. I'm looking for the best place to store it semi-long term, ideally on AWS. I want to load data into my model directly from this location, not requiring any intermediate resource.

On current thinking, I'm considering storing my data in a database, where each record has a unique ID. Whenever I want to train a model, I would get all the unique IDs, then randomly partition those IDs into train and test sets. Then I would use those partitioned IDs to query the database, pull out the selected records, and feed them into the model training pipeline. So all my database would need to do is allow for fast retrieval at scale (I have a massive amount of data).

When not training/evaluating a model, I will have no need to do anything with the database. So literally all the database must do is allow me to pull out a lot of individual records very quickly when requested, which will be predictable and consistent. No aggregation will be required, and the actual computation of training my models will occur on EC2.

# Description of data

I have a very large natural language dataset with around 10 million records. Each record is a Reddit comment, with fields for unique ID, post ID, subreddit, upvotes, and comment body. All fields are strings except for upvotes which are integers. The length of the comment IDs and post IDs are fixed, while the subreddit and comment body lengths are highly variable.

# Question

Given this context, does DynamoDB even make sense? I ask because it falls under the ""Always Free"" tier, so it seems I could store up to 25 GB of data indefinitely for zero cost using Dynamo DB. The alternative would be an S3 bucket, which would definitely work for my purposes, but that's not a database, and it would also cost me money.

I’m on a team developing some software. Each teammate makes contributions on their own branch, then submits pull requests to merge into the shared branch `dev`. After several days on `my-branch`, I was ready to submit a pull request, but needed to merge in the latest `dev` first. To keep the commit history clean, I used `git rebase`. I ran exactly this command sequence:

    $ git checkout dev
    $ git pull
    $ git checkout my-branch
    $ git rebase dev

Upon `git rebase dev`, I got the following output:

    Auto-merging [path redacted]
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in [path redacted]
    error: could not apply [commit hash redacted]
    Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
    ""git add/rm [conflicted_files]"", then run ""git rebase --continue"".
    You can instead skip this commit: run ""git rebase --skip"".
    To abort and get back to the state before ""git rebase"", run ""git rebase --abort"".
    Could not apply [commit hash redacted]
    fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref

That’s mostly `git` jibberish to me, though conflicts were to be expected since my team has several members all actively pushing code to `dev`.

Anyway, after submitting that command, I started seeing `fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref` after everything, even non-`git` commands.

    $ pwd
    fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref
    [path redacted]

Perhaps Reddit implements some GET/POST limits or something on how much data you can scrape at once. However, I don't even see an option in the PRAW API to scrape everything.

    >>> [attr for attr in dir(redditor.submissions) if not attr.startswith('_')]
    ['VALID_TIME_FILTERS', 'controversial', 'hot', 'new', 'parse', 'top']

This suggests that PRAW can scrape `redditor`'s controversial, hot, new, and top posts, however each of those would return only a subset of all posts from `redditor`. So I don't even see an option to scrape everything even if I wanted to.

The same is true for comments:

But I dunno, I just don't get it. I had initially thought a `Predictor` was, intuitively, the ""glue"" needed on the backend to link up a `Model` and a `DatasetReader` and have them share information, but I'm able to train a model using `allennlp train` + a config without so much as (knowingly) touching a `Predictor`.

We are totally bootstrapped. The first year was very hard but in the second and third year we did decent business and even built a AI product from the money we got through our consulting practice.

However this year (4th year) things have started to go south. I am not sure whether world over there is a recessionary climate and hence we are doing badly or perhaps we ourselves are doing something wrong. We also talked to fellow founders and the signals are mixed. Some say it is the boat going down with the tide (all startups are languishing). Some have asked us to introspect within. 

The major problem we are facing now is as follows:

We are unable to attract talent (as everyone is afraid of joining a startup in this current climate). We get 0-1 yrs experience people but then we end up investing a lot of time training them and bringing them up to speed. Hence we are not really growing in terms of cross pollination of ideas and experience a experienced employee would bring.

We do enjoy some good reputation in our niche AI circle and get a lot of knocks on the door from prospective clients without any extravagant marketing or advertisement.

But the moment they see our company's strength of just 8 data scientists, most prospective clients express an apprehension to do business fearing that we may not be able to deliver (though we always show testimonials from clients to ally this fear).

So overall we are faced with a catch 22 situation this year. We don't want to over hire when there is no projects or work. But on the other hand if we don't show a decent team size, companies are reluctant to give business to us.

Some suggestions from fellow co founders and friends include pivoting to a edtech solution since we are well regarded in our niche AI domain. They suggest we could start teaching and training people in the AI solutions for the interim. 

But we fear that that would send mixed signals to our prospective clients and we will be seen as a edtech or training company rather than a AI product/solutions company.

In addition we also have an internship program where we try to pick diligent and smart college students, train them and see if they would be good fit with us in future for a FTE. The interns do get paid a stipend. 

1 of our employee from the 4 FTE is actually an intern who impressed us with his work and also found our work culture likeable. We are fully remote company by the way. Impressed with his work, at the end of his internship we offered a full time employment. 

However, he refused our offer. 6 months down the line, he himself called us and expressed his interest to join us again. 

We hired this guy as we found hiring was getting difficult for us as a startup and paid him slightly above market salary keeping in view his potential. First few months he worked fine. However, in the past few months his behavior has taken a turn for the worse.

I as a co-founder, of late have given him multiple tasks with a deadline (since it is a client given deadline in return). However, he flat out refused to work !!

On one occasion, he had some family function for which he took 2 days leave (Mon- Tuesday). Every Friday, we have catch up call with the client to show our progress reports (codes, ppts etc).  On Thursday, when it was time to review the report internally, this guy says he was not able to manage time properly the whole week due to the family function and hence won't be able to present to the client.

I mean isn't this total lack of responsibility ?  I had a loss of face with the client for lack of output that week. 

In an other instance, this same employee could not get the task done by 5pm Friday. We had a presentation the next Monday. We requested him to put in extra hours and finish the work. However he again cited some frivolous reasons like 'gotta flight to catch' and hence can't work late in evening. The other FTE working on the same project with identical scope of work finished the work in stipulated time.

In an other instance, we had a similar situation. He simply struggled with a basic excel report. Upon confronting him on his failure to deliver, he said his skills were a little rusty . I mean as a employer I am not paying some guy to tell me 'his skills are rusty'. Isn't it his responsibility to keep current with his skillset?

Right now, more than his inefficiency, it is his total insubordination and outright on the face refusal to work and complete the tasks that is big worry for me. 

His attitude may have a bad effect on fellow employees too. Already his bad throughput has affected us. As a growing company I don't want to get distracted by this one employee.

Also, I don't want to be seen as an easy boss who tolerates this backtalk and frivolous excuses. 

It has been 6 months since we hired full time and already the experience has been rocky. 

My opinion is that inefficiency and lack of skill can be improved. But the attitude of 'no respect', 'no responsibility' & 'insubordination' can't be improved.

As a startup founder, this would be my first firing (If I got with it). I thought I would be careful in hiring so that I would not have to face this tough situation so early on. But I guess I can't predict how people change or perhaps I failed to read the red flags early on. 

I am also questioning our fully remote setup. Perhaps it is not a good idea to let freshers work remotely fully. I feel I am not able to establish the chain of command or discipline due to this remote set up. Anyhow that is a question I would like to ponder later.

My philosophy is that POC should also be paid. Since we are dealing with their real data and we are vesting a lot of time & energy doing R&D. In certain cases, our novel usage of algorithms itself could prove to be a IP for the client.

Some of these clients compare our services to freemium software offerings and say ""If companies can offer software usage for free up to certain time period, why can't you guys consult for us for free till we gain confidence in your services?""

Am I right in demanding pay for the POCs ? And what points can I use to retort back to clients when they wrongly compare consulting to freemium software ?

Edit: Just to avoid confusion. By POC I mean proof of concept. Also since some ppl here asked about more specifics. We are not entirely a new company. We have been in business for 4 yrs. The founder and myself have 12 yrs of relevant experience . We are also trained statisticians (may be you could call us data scientists too).",False,False,startups,Should POCs be paid ?,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/wyyolg/should_pocs_be_paid/

I'm working on a project right now, and I'm running into a weird problem with some regression models. I won't go too much into detail as to why, but I have a few different estimates of the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a group of people. One is based off of photographs of the people. The others are based on regression models that use age and sex as inputs. Each regression model is trained on data from a large-scale health study.

The first regression model uses just age and sex (0 for women, 1 for men): `bmi = age + sex`. The second adds an interaction term `bmi = age + sex + age*sex`. The third also adds age-squared `bmi = age + sex + age*sex + age^2 + sex*age^2`. The results of the first two models are fine, but the third model puts a hard maximum (around 26.8 BMI) on the men but not the women and clusters the men around that maximum. You can see some scatter plots illustrating what I mean [here](https://imgur.com/a/AEU9ZZE). 

I've tried a few things to try and stop this from happening, but nothing seems to change it. I tried removing the age-squared/sex interaction term. I tried using a few different powers of age. I tried training models separately for men and women. Nothing has changed that weird result. At this point, it seems like using age-squared might just be a misspecified model that I should stop using, but if that's the case, I'd really like to know what is going on here.

I was rooting for Asuka and Shinji—I wanted them to fall in love and have a happier ending that we got in EoE. I suppose that the end of 3+1 leaves some room for that to happen after the curtains close. However, we don't have any textual evidence to say that it does. And I'd say we have a pretty good hint in the beach scene that it won't. With that said, we also don't have any real evidence that Mari and Shinji are romantically involved at the end either, but I would say it's strongly implied that they are. The rest of this post is predicated on that assumption, but that assumption is 100% open to debate.

With that out of the way: I'm actually pretty happy with Mari and Shinji even though I wasn't at first. What made me change my mind on that was thinking more about the beach scene with Shinji and Asuka in 3+1. They admit that they liked each other as kids but that they've moved past it. To (many of) us viewers, it seems like two people who went through so much together and shared an attraction through all of it would end up together in the end. However, the feelings they share are those of young teens. To a 14 year old, a crush is a huge deal. It's something totally new to them, and may as well be as large a part of their lives as third impact.

To draw an example from my own life: When I was 14, I had a crush like that. It seemed to me that we would be perfect together and that this crush was the most important thing that had happened in my life so far, and that if we got together it would be the single point around which the rest of my life would hinge. We didn't end up together forever. We never even dated. I never acted on it, and then I got older and met new people and found new crushes Now that I'm in my late 20s with a woman I didn't even know when I was 14 I hardly ever think about how I hard I used to crush on that girl. However, if someone were to watch a movie about me at 14 and then flash forward to me now, it would feel kind of unfulfilling to see me with someone unknown without seeing the 10+ intervening years.  

Growing up is a major theme of Evangelion, and part of growing up is accepting that not every part of your life will be exactly like you imagined it because what you imagine may change. The person you were madly in love with at 14 probably won't be the person you spend the rest of your life with. This could be a source of anxiety and sadness, but it shouldn't be necessarily. Leaving some parts of your life behind and admitting new things in are vital parts of personal growth, and by seeing that Shinji and Asuka don't end up together we are given an opportunity to learn that lesson from fiction rather than through our own heartbreak. And by saying that Shinji should have ended up with Asuka (or with Rei for that matter) we're clinging to those old feelings while life keeps moving on.

To bring this back to that last scene: when we see Shinji and Mari in the train station we're seeing the end result of (I would guess) 14 years of personal growth in an entirely different world that Shinji rewrote. Just as Shinji found a way to leave behind all the important events of the movies and wish for a world without Evangelion, he's also leaving behind his childlike feelings for Asuka and moving into a more mature relationship with Mari. As a viewer who was emotionally invested in Asuka and Shinji that was admittedly tough to see. It left me feeling a special sort of melancholy, but my feelings aren't what is important here. One of the other big themes of NGE is that you have to live your life for yourself, and that's what we see Shinji doing here. He's not going with one of the waifus we've all known and loved to please the crowd. He's going with someone else—someone new—because that is what will make him happy. And to bastardize Camus: I think we should imagine Shinji happy.",True,False,evangelion,Some thoughts on the last scene and on growing up,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/p5lau8/some_thoughts_on_the_last_scene_and_on_growing_up/

More accurately, I scraped about 18,000 posts from this sub, cleaned them, and ran them through an out of the box text-generation neural network to get AI-generated dreams. A lot of them were total nonsense, but a handful of them actually came out somewhat coherent and sounded   
 almost like actual dreams that someone might have. 

I've made some minor edits to some of these for clarity. Mostly that means correcting punctuation, getting rid of grammatical errors that made their way in, or removing long strings of repeats (this AI tends to create sentances like ""I was in a house with my family and my family and my family and my family"").  However, the core of the dreams always come from the AI. 

An example of a more-or-less nonsensical dream (or rather an excerpt because the whole dream is like 4x this length):

>I had a dream where I was in a school and I was sitting on the edge of a highway that was on the sea. And the water was very shallow and I could see the stars were turning into a wolf’s dog. And I was trying to get it out of my mouth but it was too long and thick and it was like a mix of guns and knives. And the walls were covered in the toilet and I was trying to get away from the turkey and I was stressing out.

&#x200B;

This one sounds like a stress dream. Actually, come to think of it, a lot of the AI generated dreams sound like stress dreams or nightmares:

>I was in a house with my family and my brothers were there. Then we were on a path in the mountains and I was surrounded by trees, but I knew I was going to be caught by the police and punished. My father was there and we were getting ready to go to the hospital. I was trying to get my mom to help me but I couldn't get close to him. I don't know how I knew, but he was me and I was so confused I said I was a little freaked out and that I was going to die. I was also mildly lucid dreaming and woke up in a sweat.

&#x200B;

A lot of the generated dreams are also entertainingly inane, like this one:

>I have a recurring dream where I am on a holiday or somewhere. I’m not really sure why I’m having these dreams.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, the AI managed to put together that these should generally start with something like ""I had a dream"" and it commonly ends with either something about waking up, or something about wanting to know what the dream means. 

>I had a dream that I was in a school and I was in a rush to a hotel with a girl I knew from school and she was pretty nice to me. I liked her a lot and I was wondering if she was alive. I was so confused she asked me if I was ok, and I said “I don't know.” I just want to know what it means.

&#x200B;

I think this next one is probably my favorite. Definetly sounds like a nightmare, and honestly gives me the creeps:

>I was in a house then I was watching TV at a cafe that was a carnival ride with a total stranger I had a crush on. Then I was on the bed watching TV and I noticed a dark silhouette in front of my eyes. It was disgusting and I was crying. I woke up. I forgot what happened but my brain just went on and I woke up.

A bit about myself: Straight male, mid-20s, slightly lean introvert, feeling a lot of stress about applying for grad schools and about the election. I have only the most tenuous connection to the Navajo in that in high school, I used to go on a church-sponsored mission/service trip to the Utah part of the reservation. I'm no longer very religious. I know a little bit about their actual mythology, but I'm no expert by any means, and I don't think anything in my dream points to actual Navajo mythology. Without further ado, my dream:

I'm walking with someone through a suburban neighborhood in the deserts of the American Southwest. It's a foggy, overcast day, and I can't see very far. My companion (who I can't see as they walk behind me) is telling me stories from Navajo folklore as we walk. We come to a T-shaped intersection. We're on the left side of the top of the T, and we stop in the middle of the intersection. The road we're on curves off between two large rock faces with shiny, smooth boulders protruding from them. The road that ends at the T is very straight and goes off into the distance. 

I can feel wind blowing from behind me into the area with the rock faces, and I feel a powerful sense of dread coming from it. My companion tells me that the spirits of the dead reside there, and that we should not go that way. He then begins telling me a story of the queen of the gods, and how she was born on a rocky outcropping right near where we're standing. 

As soon as he says this, a huge gust of wind blows the fog away from the intersection, and I can see the outcropping just past the houses at the top of the T. I turn around and see the wind keep blowing down the straight road behind us (the bottom of the T) and pushing back the fog. It reveals a large mountain or mesa in the distance. My companion tells me that the road was built on an ancient route that the Navajo would walk along to commemorate the journey of the queen of the gods from her birthplace to that mountain in the distance. 

That's when I was awoken by my alarm. For some reason, this feels like an important and meaningful dream, but I can't think of what it might mean.

The title sums it up pretty well: I'm an American software engineer considering a move to Europe and wondering what my best options are. I'd probably be looking at doing this in the next year or two -- ideally once the world is no longer shut down.

A bit about me: I'm 26 and I have a BA in Economics from a mediocre school, but I've been working in software for almost three years now: first at a startup, and now at a US government institution, both of which are in San Francisco. Most of my experience has been in front-end development (mainly React) but I have a bit of backend experience (some Node from my old job, some Java from my new job, and some Python from a volunteer project). I'm also very interested in (eventually) working in either data science or data engineering. I'm also going to be getting a handful of AWS certs (Solutions Architect and Developer) that my company is paying for, and I'd have those by the time I'd be looking at making a move.

I think my main target countries would be the UK and Germany, but I'd also consider the Netherlands, Ireland, the Nordic countries, and maybe Switzerland. I studied German for a while, and actually studied in Berlin for a year back in college. My German has gotten rusty, but if I was speaking it regularly, I'm pretty sure I could get it back up to B2, which is where I was while I was there.

Before you ask, I don't have any easy EU ancestry: no Italian or Irish grandparents, and my recent German and Austrian ancestors are all maternal, so that's also a no go. With that in mind, I see four main options for me:

1. Try to get in with my current experience. Basically apply for jobs with my 3+ years of experience and see if anyone bites. This seems like it might be hard without a related degree, but I may be off base about that.
2. Look into European masters programs and use the job seeker visa afterwards to find something. This seems like it may be my surest shot, assuming I could get in somewhere good. My background is economics, so I might look into some econ programs, but that doesn't seem like it would be helpful in getting a job, so I'm guessing I'd be better off looking into CS or maybe Stats programs.
3. US masters and then apply. This seems like my worst option since it would leave me looking for jobs in Europe with US levels of student debt and much less name recognition. 
4. Try to find a job here with a big company and transfer. This is probably my longest time horizon option, which isn't ideal, but it also comes with the plus of being the most lucrative option. However, I recently started my new job, and I don't especially like my chances of getting into a FAANG or other big company right now.

Any advice you guys can offer would be appreciated. Thanks!

As a side note, it's amazing how  much easier it is to recall my dreams now that I've started writing them down. For context, I'm a straight man in my mid-20s, and according to the Jungian archetype quiz trending on the sub right now, the archetype most prominent in my personality is the Seeker. 

I'm back in college. It's move-in day, and I'm very excited to meet new people and try new things. When I get to my room and start moving things in, I find out that my roommate is someone I knew in high school, both in the dream and in real life. In real life, he was a very annoying, abrasive person who a lot of people made fun of. In the dream, he was being very particular about where I put my things, but mellowed out as I moved more things in. 

Once I'm done moving things in, I sit down and look around. My roommate sits down as his computer and starts programming a small robot he was working on. All of the books and furniture on my side of the dorm are things from my current apartment, including my desk with my new gaming computer on it. As I look at all of the good things I'd accumulated, I start feeling very proud of myself that I'd worked so hard, and it was finally paying off.

Just then, we hear a crash from outside and look out our window. The street outside looks like the street I grew up on. A car had crashed into the house of the person across the street. There is a woman with stringy red hair, inhumanly large blue eyes, and very pale skin in the drivers seat. I know stole this car from the neighbors, and I was about to call the police, but I see an old Japanese couple across the street calling them. Instead I start writing down the description of the woman so I could give it to the cops when they show up. The woman drives off, and someone comes in to our dorm to tell us that they are filming a movie outside and not to be alarmed. I don't believe that explanation, but change my mind when I see the woman drive the car back laden with filming equipment.

Later, I hear an even louder noise and go outside to see what's going on. In the distance, I see a giant kaiju like monster. It has three dragon heads, each on a long neck like a hydra, but the body of a man, and the feet of a dragon. It's mostly charcoal grey, but has some lines of dark red/burgundy running across it. Somehow, I know that this monster was once the woman who stole the car.

The old Japanese man who called the police removes his clothes and turns into a giant to fight the kaiju. He is joined by another giant man with a trench coat, fedora, and Tommy gun, and by a Godzilla-like monster. When the giant old man sees the giant in a trench coat, he says ""I always knew it would end alongside that trench coat."" As they do battle, my roommate and I debate which one of the good giants is the most noble. I say it is the old man because ""he didn't have to return to this life, but he did.""

The three headed kaiju continues to grow, and as its heads touch the clouds, it takes a few strides to a huge suspension bridge stretching across a bay. It crushes this bridge, which creates a huge tsunami that threatens the city we are in. The Godzilla monster tries to block the wave with its body, but fails. I look up and see the three-headed kaiju, still growing, raise its foot. As the kaiju's foot starts to come down above me and the wave continues to bear down on me, I wake up.",False,False,DreamInterpretation,Car Theft and Kaiju,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/hykzs3/car_theft_and_kaiju/

Found out about this sub from r/Jung a few days ago, an thought that I'd try my hand at posting something here after the nightmare I had last night.

Last night I had a dream that I was playing an old school point and click adventure game with my girlfriend. I was sitting at an old computer (big, beige CRT monitor) and playing it while my girlfriend sat next to me and watched. However, once the game started, it was like the screen took up my whole vision.

The game took place in an ancient Chinese palace, and reminded me of a game called *Qin: Tomb of the Middle Kingdom* ([video link for the curious)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmjnsWT3CRE), which was one of the first computer games I ever played. Most of the areas in this dream were single screens where I couldn't interact with anything but the area I was looking at, but some let me pan my view around with the mouse top get a panoramic view of the area.

There was one room in particular I was excited to show my girlfriend. It looked like some major palace room, maybe the throne room. It was made of very smooth, shiny black granite with details in gold, and green carpets along the floor. As I was panning the camera around to see the whole room, I saw a butler in a tuxedo standing in one corner of the room. I immediately started to feel nervous because I knew that this character wasn't supposed to be in the game. When we noticed him, he started to talk to my girlfriend and me directly, not to the character I was playing, although I don't remember what he said to us. 

As he took some steps towards me, fast-paced drum/gamelan music began to play, and I started feeling extremely scared. My girlfriend started screaming from fright. I turned my character around, and started clicking to try to get out of the room, but every click seemed to take me back into the room, until I finally managed to get into a side room. This room was decorated a lot like the throne room, with black granite and green carpet. It also had a daybed, some couches, and a sort of booth with a curtain in front of it, almost like a small changing room. I went into the booth, and as I did the curtains in front of it closed themselves. As I waited in the booth, my girlfriend and I strained to her any noise coming from the game that would tell us what was going on outside the booth.

That was when I woke up, heart beating out of my chest

Genre: Art game - you went around to different areas and played different minigames and did little art projects a la Kid Pix

Estimated year of release: Late 90s or early 2000s, I would guess between 1998 and 2002

Graphics/Art style: Claymation/puppet like. Think the James and the Giant Peach movie.

Notable characters: At least some of the characters were inscets. I seem to remember a beatnik ladybug with a red beret.

Notable gameplay mechanics: Don't remember much here. It was first person. I think you clicked around to move your character through areas and in each one, there was a character who would give you a minigame or let you draw/paint something.

Other details: I think the game was called something like Exploratorium or Imaginarium.

Still, something about that anime has stuck with me, and I'd like to be able to identify it.

This is what I remember about it:
It was about people with wings, possibly angels of some sort, and they could have either black or white wings. I don't think it was quite as straightforward as black == bad, because I seem to recall one of the main characters' wings turning black, but not 100% on that.

Speaking of characters, the MC was a girl with white wings, from what I can remember. Another character was her male friend, who's wings turned black.

I saw this probably around 2000-2002, but it could have come out any time before that. I think it was a TV series, because I vaguely remember what I saw being bookended by ""last time on"" and ""next time on"" segments, but I suppose it could have been a series of movies with those on them.

Hi all, thanks in advance for your advice.

I'm trying to determine whether certain product feature improvements increased the number of monthly active users (active is defined as whether the user made a purchase in the last 28 days). We have the ability to A/B test but I'm getting stuck because this MAU metric is a moving window metric. If we run the experiment for exactly 28 days then I think calculating the impact to MAU is easy. But most of the time our experiments run for more or less days than 28 days. Below are a few scenarios to illustrate my point.

Note: All scenarios are A/B tests where we split our user base into equal treatment and control groups. So far, I've been calculating ""MAU Rate"", which is the proportion of users who placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment.

* Scenario 1: Run experiment for exactly 28 days. At the end of 28 days, simply compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order.
* Scenario 2: Run experiment for less than 28 days, say 14 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will include days from before the experiment started. If I use only the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for only 14 days.
* Scenario 3: Run experiment for more than 28 days, say 35 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will exclude data from the first 7 days of the experiment. If I use all the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for 35 days.

My wife and I are wanting to buy a house. Maybe I am too fiscally conservative but it just feels like a huge step and I don't know if we are ready.

&#x200B;

* Overview: We are both 30 years old, working, no kids. We plan to have kids in the next 2-3 years though. We live in Seattle and have no plans to move any time soon even though I know it's expensive.
* Income: Unfortunately neither of us are software engineers. Our total yearly cash comp is 235k. She works at Amazon and makes $65k/year (this includes her equity). I work at a startup with a salary of $170k/year. I have stock options which are hard to value because they could be worth $0. If I'm being slightly optimistic, I think the options could be worth $250k - $300k but I'm not counting on this.
* Savings:
   * Retirement: We have a combined $290k in our 401ks, Roth IRAs, and brokerage. We both max this our 401ks and Roth IRAs.
   * Liquid savings: We have a combined $155k in our checkings and savings accounts. I expect to add $21k to this in the next 3 months because we are living rent free for the next 3 months. 
* Debt: $15k student loans. No other debt.
* Current expenses:
   * We use to live in Seattle, but because we can work remotely, we have been living rent free with our parents for the last 3 months. We will live with them for another 3 months until we have to move back to Seattle to go back in to the office. While living rent free, our expenses are of course minimal and we are saving about $7k per month to non-retirement savings. Once we move back to Seattle, I expect our expenses to be $5 -  $5.5k/month. I am an avid YNAB user so I track this pretty closely.
* Other: My wife is looking for a new job and hopefully her salary will increase to $90-$100k. However, that hasn't happened yet so I'm not including it in my calculations.
* House:
   * I'm thinking we can afford a $750k house. Of our $155k savings, I think we'll do a $75k down payment, $15k for fees and furnishings, and the rest of the $65k for the emergency fund.

Hi. I moved into data science from data analysis and I've had the title of data scientist for a few years while still doing mostly analysis and very little model building. This is entirely led by what I've been asked to do in an organization that's slowly maturing in data literacy. We've spent years moving decisions off of isolated spreadsheets on managers' desktops.

Now we're maturing under new leadership and the emphasis is on hiring outside experts, building and deploying the models they create, and the role of internal data science is to maintain them. This ""feels"" like ML Ops but I'm no software developer, so this is pretty new territory to me.

Following what I thought was an alright, but not great, interview, the HR coordinator asked me to stay on for a minute, and then she told me ""We don't use the words husband, wife or spouse. Only partner."" I was astonished, said I didn't agree with that since my wife would self-describe as my wife, and that was that.

Has anyone ever encountered this? Given the lackluster interview I wasn't thinking anything further would come, but I'm kind of inclined to send a note and say that ... I dunno, it's not offense, it's just such a strange thing for someone to say and it really bothers me that people think this.

Update: I called the HR coordinator to withdraw my candidacy. I said I didn't feel an affinity with the group. Her response was brief ""I don't think anyone has done that,but I'll let the hiring manager know."" I told her I also felt put off by her comment. Her response was a terse ""You know, we all felt you were not right for the role, either.""

Hiring manager called an hour later, asked if I had an offer (I didn't) if I was interviewing with a competitor (I'm not), asked what I didn't like about the role. I said the same about affinity and mentioned the coordinator's comment. Long pause. ""Look, I think we're trying to figure out the company we need to be. Keep in touch."" Interesting.

Update update: After a few more interviews I landed a job.
