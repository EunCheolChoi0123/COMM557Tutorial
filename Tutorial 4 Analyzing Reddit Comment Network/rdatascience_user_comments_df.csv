import webbrowser
webbrowser.open'https://www.healthLine.com/nutrition/how-to-Lose-weight-as-fi

It looks like there are several issues in the provided code snippet. Let's clean it up:

1. Remove the unnecessary imports of the webbrowser module, as it only needs to be imported once.
2. Correct the webbrowser.open syntax.
3. Define the conditions that determine which website should be opened based on the BMI value.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import webbrowser

def bmi_calculator(height, weight):
    bmi = (weight / height**2) * 703
    
    if bmi < 18.5:
        webbrowser.open('https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-ner')
    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 24.9:
        webbrowser.open('https://www.nda.ath.gov/health/maintaining-healthy-weight')
    elif 24.9 <= bmi < 30:
        webbrowser.open('https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-gain-weight')
    else:
        webbrowser.open('https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-as-fi')

height = float(input(""Enter your height in inches: ""))
weight = float(input(""Enter your weight in lbs: ""))
bmi_calculator(height, weight)
```

I assumed that the BMI ranges correspond to specific conditions and linked to the relevant URLs. You may need to adjust the conditions and URLs according to your specific needs. If something is not clear, please let me know so I can provide further clarification.

Please provide reason and stuff to try if the link doesn‚Äôt automatically open.

Certainly! If the link doesn't automatically open, there could be several reasons for that, and here's what you can try:

1. **Default Web Browser Issue:**
   - **Reason:** Your system might not have a default web browser set.
   - **What to Try:** Ensure that you have a default web browser set in your operating system's settings.

2. **Firewall or Security Software:**
   - **Reason:** Some security software might block Python from opening web pages.
   - **What to Try:** Check your firewall or security software settings to see if Python is being blocked. Adding an exception for Python might solve the issue.

3. **Malformed URL:**
   - **Reason:** The URL might be incorrect or not properly formatted.
   - **What to Try:** Verify that the URL is correct and properly formatted.

4. **PyCharm's Interaction with the Web Browser:**
   - **Reason:** Depending on the configuration of PyCharm and the system, the `webbrowser.open` call might not function as expected.
   - **What to Try:** Try running the script outside of PyCharm, directly from the terminal, to see if the issue is specific to PyCharm.

5. **Consider Using a Specific Browser:**
   - **Reason:** The `webbrowser` module tries to use the default browser, but it might fail in some environments.
   - **What to Try:** You can use the `webbrowser.get()` method to specify a particular browser. For example, to use Firefox:
     ```python
     firefox = webbrowser.get('firefox')
     firefox.open('https://www.example.com')
     ```

6. **Python's `webbrowser` Module Compatibility:**
   - **Reason:** The `webbrowser` module might have compatibility issues with certain versions of browsers or operating systems.
   - **What to Try:** Ensure that your Python installation, web browser, and operating system are up-to-date.

7. **Permissions Issue in the Operating System:**
   - **Reason:** The user running the script might not have the necessary permissions to open a web browser.
   - **What to Try:** Check the user permissions on your system, and try running the script with appropriate permissions.

By investigating along these lines, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing the link from opening. If you encounter any specific errors or issues, please share them for more targeted assistance.","<div class=""md""><p>Please fix this code for a Reddit user.

A) He stole the laptop and tried to get an RMA for it. But now he lost it. While possible and I don't think it's the case here.

Committing my main machine to it and forcing myself to use it really worked wonder. I absolutely love it! Changing the horrible default theme and dropping the task bar in the bottom solved 90% of my hate for it. Now into the serious stuff. I went with Ubuntu 23.04 Desktop minimal install.

Pros:

\-very stable, no bug whatsoever compared to let's says RHEL with it's horrendous SELinux.

\-fast, low on memory.

\-great support for all ML stuff with no tinkering

Cons:

\-average optimization out of the box. I was getting sub windows performance in python but I was able to fix it by implementing some kernel sysctl tweaks used by RHEL with the HPC tuning profile.

\-sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance; by default even if using performance mode, the governor is power save.

\-sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10

\-sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty\_background\_ratio=3

ChatGPT answer:  


Based on the results of your tests, your network seems to be performing reasonably well, even under peak load conditions.  
  
Packet Loss (tcp.analysis.ack\_lost\_segment): This is extremely low across all scenarios. It's great that this is effectively 0% for normal traffic and intermittent peak traffic. Even in the extreme case, the lost segments are minimal.  
  
Retransmissions (tcp.analysis.retransmission): Your retransmission rates are quite low in all three scenarios. The fact that retransmissions don't significantly increase under high load conditions indicates that your network and buffers are handling the increased traffic well.  
  
Window Update (tcp.analysis.window\_update): The window update percentages are also quite low in all scenarios. This indicates that the TCP window sizes aren't being frequently adjusted, which is another good sign.  
  
Round Trip Time (tcp.analysis.ack\_rtt): The average RTTs are excellent for the normal and intermittent peak traffic scenarios. In the extreme case, the average RTT increases to 70ms, which is higher but not alarming. The worst RTT value observed under extreme conditions (365ms) could potentially introduce noticeable delay in time-sensitive applications, but it is acceptable considering the heavy load.  
  
Please note that these findings are based on the provided information and they indicate your network's performance from a general perspective. Depending on the nature of your applications and their specific performance requirements, you might still experience issues under certain circumstances. However, from a buffering perspective, it seems like your NIC's RX/TX buffer sizes are set optimally for the load scenarios you've tested.

<p>ChatGPT answer:  </p>

<p>Based on the results of your tests, your network seems to be performing reasonably well, even under peak load conditions.</p>

<p>Packet Loss (tcp.analysis.ack_lost_segment): This is extremely low across all scenarios. It&#39;s great that this is effectively 0% for normal traffic and intermittent peak traffic. Even in the extreme case, the lost segments are minimal.</p>

<p>Retransmissions (tcp.analysis.retransmission): Your retransmission rates are quite low in all three scenarios. The fact that retransmissions don&#39;t significantly increase under high load conditions indicates that your network and buffers are handling the increased traffic well.</p>

<p>Window Update (tcp.analysis.window_update): The window update percentages are also quite low in all scenarios. This indicates that the TCP window sizes aren&#39;t being frequently adjusted, which is another good sign.</p>

<p>Round Trip Time (tcp.analysis.ack_rtt): The average RTTs are excellent for the normal and intermittent peak traffic scenarios. In the extreme case, the average RTT increases to 70ms, which is higher but not alarming. The worst RTT value observed under extreme conditions (365ms) could potentially introduce noticeable delay in time-sensitive applications, but it is acceptable considering the heavy load.</p>

<p>Please note that these findings are based on the provided information and they indicate your network&#39;s performance from a general perspective. Depending on the nature of your applications and their specific performance requirements, you might still experience issues under certain circumstances. However, from a buffering perspective, it seems like your NIC&#39;s RX/TX buffer sizes are set optimally for the load scenarios you&#39;ve tested.  </p>

234,Pataouga,"Hello, I just started my first data science project for my portfolio. It's just about missing value imputations some data analysis and visualisations(got help from other notebooks on this part). I will soon add a prediction part and maybe try to save it to an sql database to showcase some begginer skills or maybe try powerBI too(I'm begginer at these two but studying them). Is anyone available to see my notebook and give some reccomendations? Like if I should include something or exclude. Any ideas to incoporate for example SQL to showcase some skill to potential employers or a powerBI idea. Finally I would like some critic to know if it's good as a first project and what could be better for an employer to see from me for my let's say first junior job. Thank you

Edit: here is the file. I just learnt about multiple imputations in R with the mice package in uni. So this is the best thing I found in python. I am also thinking about if I can built another multiple imputed model and cross validate between them. In R I learned how to take MSEs for each model, compare R2 for every model and much more. But I can‚Äôt still apply them into python. I‚Äôm much better in R(been studying till undergrad) but I‚Äôm switching to python for learning and work purposes.

It&#39;s just about missing value imputations some data analysis and visualisations(got help from other notebooks on this part). I will soon add a prediction part and maybe try to save it to an sql database to showcase some begginer skills or maybe try powerBI too(I&#39;m begginer at these two but studying them). Is anyone available to see my notebook and give some reccomendations? Like if I should include something or exclude.

278,Pataouga,"Tbh it‚Äôs kinda hard because you are too far away and probably without salary as a student. I got many offers for viewings so I think there are houses just not for anyone. I was into the 1400‚Ç¨ per month range for even a small studio and I had choices. But I saw people posting about wanting to rent for 300-400 including utilities. That‚Äôs not realistic and that‚Äôs probably the 80% of the homeless students. I can‚Äôt even imagine how many students are looking for 500 max budget rooms. One more thing is you can‚Äôt be picky as a student. You maybe won‚Äôt have a viewing and you will be over charged. I found a 38m2 apartment all included with gym etc with 1400‚Ç¨ per month in a week of 24/7 searching. Houses are indeed difficult. But building complexes especially for expats or exchange students usually for 6 months are usually a safe bet to start. I will look for an apartment in 6 months with pay slips and physical viewings.

P.S: Yeah finding housing is quite hard but not as impossible as people present it to be. 5/5 of my friends and me found a place to stay with registration in a month or less.

I did some research and I believe it's because of hard water because my scalp and body are also more dry than normal. I also have some back acne which I never dealed with before.

For my upper cheeks, they get dry and red out of nowhere. It has been happening for a couple months. It will get better and then start again after nowhere. I also did research on this and I think it might be seborrheic dermatitis. I don't have the money to go to a dermatologist though. 

I really just want my red, dry cheeks to get better as they are very irritating. Did anybody else go through the same thing? Do you guys have any advice? I used to have so much acne on my cheeks and jawline and finally cleared it up not long ago so I'm feeling sad that it's coming back.

My skin is very sensitive and acne-prone.

This is my custom keyboard design! As you can see, it is a split, ergonomic, wireless build that is modeled after the Corne. The major differences are (1) the more extreme column stagger and (2) the extra thumbkey per side. It‚Äôs also wireless thanks to the nice!nano boards (a wireless, drop-in replacement for the Pro Micro/Elite-C) so all LEDs and OLED were stripped to conserve battery as well as the TRRS jack since the halves connect to each other wirelessly also. Another minor change is that I opted for Mill-Max hot swap sockets rather than the Kailh variants.

**Full story**

I started this out about a year ago after having checked in on this sub every now and then for the last few years. I started off thinking I was just going to buy a QMK compatible 75% kit with some nice switches and put it together as a little project. As I kept going down the rabbit hole, I started to become really interested in the ergonomic side of things and alternative layouts. Huge credit to [Ben Vallack](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZYyvXAdQpsEWfa6OEBOhHn48SWgneoD) for pulling me into this hole ‚Äî definitely check out his channel if you‚Äôre interested! He recently designed a board with only 9 keys per side just to push the extreme.

**Design/Build Process**

As far as my design process goes, you‚Äôll notice in the photos that I started purely on paper, and I highly recommend this to anyone starting out. Take an open source PCB and print out the layout to scale, then pretend to type on it and get a feel for the layout. You can tape some keycaps down in place to get a more realistic feel (I even started with just cardboard squares lol). This is where I decided that while I liked the column stagger that the Corne introduced, I wanted a bit more and figured I could just modify it to fit the natural stagger of my fingers. I measured out the distances between each and shifted the columns around until I found something I really liked. From here I stripped the parts I didn‚Äôt need, modified footprints to fit my needs (making the pads a bit wider helped a lot with soldering the Mill-Max sockets), and rerouted the whole thing. It‚Äôs a reversible PCB, which I did to save money. PCBWay is my go-to manufacturer so I ordered from there and then it was time to design a case. I did this in Fusion 360 and used a resin 3D printer I had access to at work to fabricate it. The case was designed to allow for tenting at a variety of angles, but the accessory parts that were designed to allow this ended up warping pretty badly due to their thinness, so I just ended up using the main case parts. The switch plates are also 3D printed and didn‚Äôt warp quite as badly, but I would love to redo these by laser-cutting them from acrylic or aluminum. Lastly, the firmware! I‚Äôm using ZMK, which is kind of like QMK but geared toward wireless builds. They also use GitHub actions to really streamline the build/setup process. I‚Äôm using the Colemak DH (aka Colemak Mod-DH or DHm) layout, so setting this was the first step, but also wanted the option to switch to a QWERTY layer. FWIW, I‚Äôm using colemakacademy to learn it and I‚Äôm up to a measly 38 WPM on ‚Äúlevel 3‚Äù which includes only the 14 most used keys ‚Äî really great website and couldn‚Äôt think of a better way to learn a new layout. It took me a while to set the rest of the layout for symbols and modifiers and everything, and I‚Äôm really glad I implemented the additional thumbkeys for this part. I ended up with 6 total layers: the Colemak and QWERTY layers, raise and lower, function/media keys (super nice for my iOS devices ‚Äî volume, brightness, and media controls), and numpad. There was some odd troubleshooting I had to do where the right half wasn‚Äôt pairing to the left half properly and a few issues with layers because I didn‚Äôt know that their order in the .keymap file mattered, but I finally got it working like I want!

Using some blank PBT keycaps from AliExpress and the Boba U4 silent tactiles which I‚Äôm loving!

This project has been super fulfilling to complete and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested! If you have any questions at all, please let me know!

<p>This is my custom keyboard design! As you can see, it is a split, ergonomic, wireless build that is modeled after the Corne. The major differences are (1) the more extreme column stagger and (2) the extra thumbkey per side. It‚Äôs also wireless thanks to the nice!nano boards (a wireless, drop-in replacement for the Pro Micro/Elite-C) so all LEDs and OLED were stripped to conserve battery as well as the TRRS jack since the halves connect to each other wirelessly also. Another minor change is that I opted for Mill-Max hot swap sockets rather than the Kailh variants.</p>

<p><strong>Full story</strong></p>

<p>I started this out about a year ago after having checked in on this sub every now and then for the last few years. I started off thinking I was just going to buy a QMK compatible 75% kit with some nice switches and put it together as a little project. As I kept going down the rabbit hole, I started to become really interested in the ergonomic side of things and alternative layouts. Huge credit to <a href=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZYyvXAdQpsEWfa6OEBOhHn48SWgneoD"">Ben Vallack</a> for pulling me into this hole ‚Äî definitely check out his channel if you‚Äôre interested! He recently designed a board with only 9 keys per side just to push the extreme.</p>

<p><strong>Design/Build Process</strong></p>

<p>As far as my design process goes, you‚Äôll notice in the photos that I started purely on paper, and I highly recommend this to anyone starting out. Take an open source PCB and print out the layout to scale, then pretend to type on it and get a feel for the layout. You can tape some keycaps down in place to get a more realistic feel (I even started with just cardboard squares lol). This is where I decided that while I liked the column stagger that the Corne introduced, I wanted a bit more and figured I could just modify it to fit the natural stagger of my fingers. I measured out the distances between each and shifted the columns around until I found something I really liked. From here I stripped the parts I didn‚Äôt need, modified footprints to fit my needs (making the pads a bit wider helped a lot with soldering the Mill-Max sockets), and rerouted the whole thing. It‚Äôs a reversible PCB, which I did to save money. PCBWay is my go-to manufacturer so I ordered from there and then it was time to design a case. I did this in Fusion 360 and used a resin 3D printer I had access to at work to fabricate it. The case was designed to allow for tenting at a variety of angles, but the accessory parts that were designed to allow this ended up warping pretty badly due to their thinness, so I just ended up using the main case parts. The switch plates are also 3D printed and didn‚Äôt warp quite as badly, but I would love to redo these by laser-cutting them from acrylic or aluminum. Lastly, the firmware! I‚Äôm using ZMK, which is kind of like QMK but geared toward wireless builds. They also use GitHub actions to really streamline the build/setup process. I‚Äôm using the Colemak DH (aka Colemak Mod-DH or DHm) layout, so setting this was the first step, but also wanted the option to switch to a QWERTY layer. FWIW, I‚Äôm using colemakacademy to learn it and I‚Äôm up to a measly 38 WPM on ‚Äúlevel 3‚Äù which includes only the 14 most used keys ‚Äî really great website and couldn‚Äôt think of a better way to learn a new layout. It took me a while to set the rest of the layout for symbols and modifiers and everything, and I‚Äôm really glad I implemented the additional thumbkeys for this part. I ended up with 6 total layers: the Colemak and QWERTY layers, raise and lower, function/media keys (super nice for my iOS devices ‚Äî volume, brightness, and media controls), and numpad. There was some odd troubleshooting I had to do where the right half wasn‚Äôt pairing to the left half properly and a few issues with layers because I didn‚Äôt know that their order in the .keymap file mattered, but I finally got it working like I want!</p>

<p>Using some blank PBT keycaps from AliExpress and the Boba U4 silent tactiles which I‚Äôm loving!</p>

As for my thoughts regarding your post, STEM is definitely the choice over ICT, even if programming ang career choice mo. Sa college entrance exam, STEM has the upperhand. There are also universities na may strand biases, and they would limit your course options based on your course, STEM strand will give you the most options and pasok parin dito BSIT and BSCS.

In all honesty, ICT strand doesn‚Äôt give you much of an advantage in programming as someone who took another strand. Pag dating sa college, profs will assume na you don‚Äôt know how to code and they will discuss accordingly. In addition, programming is also way easier to self-study than the fundamentals. The better path would‚Äôve been to take STEM then self-study programming on the side. 

Try mong mag-shift strand if kaya. If hindi tlga, commit to self study. If kaya ng budget, merong mga review centers for college entrance exam. Start taking one right now if you‚Äôre aiming for big universities.","<div class=""md""><ul>

<p>As for my thoughts regarding your post, STEM is definitely the choice over ICT, even if programming ang career choice mo. Sa college entrance exam, STEM has the upperhand. There are also universities na may strand biases, and they would limit your course options based on your course, STEM strand will give you the most options and pasok parin dito BSIT and BSCS.</p>

<p>In all honesty, ICT strand doesn‚Äôt give you much of an advantage in programming as someone who took another strand. Pag dating sa college, profs will assume na you don‚Äôt know how to code and they will discuss accordingly. In addition, programming is also way easier to self-study than the fundamentals. The better path would‚Äôve been to take STEM then self-study programming on the side. </p>

<p>Try mong mag-shift strand if kaya. If hindi tlga, commit to self study. If kaya ng budget, merong mga review centers for college entrance exam. Start taking one right now if you‚Äôre aiming for big universities.</p>

1248,CuriousTasos,"You've got some important decisions ahead, but here's some friendly advice:  
First off, your background in psychology is a great starting point. Being a data scientist with expertise in a specific field, like psychology, can be a major advantage. You'll be able to dive deep into data within the context of psychology, revealing insights that might be missed by others. It's a unique combination that can set you apart in the data science world. In addition, you don't necessarily need a specific degree in data science to make it in the field. **Self-study** and practical skills are highly valued. However, psychology is a bit different. It usually requires that degree for professional practice.  
You can start by working on a personal project that brings together your psychology knowledge and coding skills. This hands-on experience will be valuable, showing potential employers or grad schools your passion and what you can do. Also, think about using data science into your psychology thesis. It's a great way to showcase your data science abilities while staying connected to your psychology studies. This way, when you graduate, you've got the psychology degree you wanted and a proof that you're prepared for the data science world.","<div class=""md""><p>You&#39;ve got some important decisions ahead, but here&#39;s some friendly advice:<br/>

Hi All,
So today was another day of interviewing data scientists. Today it was juniors (grads) and journeymen - people who have got 2-3 years under their belt.
I thought I would give some background thoughts and comments - if you are reading this you may well be interested in it.
Context first.
I lead a fairly big data group with platform engineers, data engineers and MI/BI team, an analyitics team and a Data Science team. And I will say that I'm personally fairly strong in the space with a lot of real world experience rather than a nonsense manager talking rubbish from above.
Really importantly - I don't work for a data company or a tech company. I work for a private company in the UK who makes money by doing other things. 99.95% of the staff do not care about data - it's a pain in the backside... they just want to do business and make money. So... at least some of what I say here does not apply for the pure tech space - maybe.
Today I had down selected 34 CV's to 8 interviews and will take two people forwards. Thats.... OK. Don't worry about the other people if you are interviewing though - just be better than them.
Lastly for context - I pay pretty well - top half of the salary band for the north of england, so this is not about ""scraping the bottom of the barrel""
The Basics
-- Wash. Brush your hair. Wear a shirt or a blouse. Smile. Talk about something when we meet - ""how was your weekend""... I'm a human. Breathe.
When you get the job, unless you work at a fancy bank then no one cares what you look like - but it's about playing the game. And the game is ""I know the rules of an interview"". A ¬£10 shirt will get you more points than a ¬£100 tshirt.
-- Women - you are (slightly) already winning
A lot is made of women in Data Science. And thats great, it's a great career. But the reality is that both myself and pretty much all the people in my position automatically assume that a woman is slightly better than an equivilant guy and certainly slightly more pragmatic. Don't worry about the gender thing - you are already very slightly ahead... we WANT the pragmatic and the sensible. Rockstars are a pain in the backside.
The three best hires of my life were all female data scienstists. 5 of the top 10 data scientists in the UK and maybe the world at the moment are female. Just be you.
The Tougher Stuff.
-- Guys.... you have to know your maths
Data Science is about ""Getting Sh** done"" - it's NOT ENOUGH to know a few algorithms and a bit of python and want in on a job. Being REALLY brutal.... I can pick up a regular python developer with 3 years dev experience and have them learn some algorithms and they would be more productive than someone who's in the ""pet algorithm camp"".
You NEED to know your maths. Stats especially - you need REALLY good stats.. And when I say that I do not at all mean *advanced* stats... I mean ""rock solid general stats"". All the basic stuff that gets glossed over. Why are we using a normal distribution when this is an Alpha skew? Why are you using a linear regression for a dynamic system? I need you to know a harmonic mean and when to use it. I really need you to be aware of things like a birthday paradox becuase every manager that you ever help out will NOT know it. Fundementals will ALWAYS beat a nice algorithm.
Biases
Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/5 of the work you get asked to do will be flat out stupid. Mostly because of biases and nonsense thinking. Wikipedia's ""list of biases"" page is amazing. It will save you more time, get you more promotions and save your employer more time than you will EVER achieve with a tweak to a codebase. Go devour it, and then TELL ME WHEN I'M BEING DUMB.
""Here is a nice answer"" gets you good points in an interview
""Here is a nice answer... but you need to be careful about X"" gives you huge points in an answer
Be Fanatical about money
Heres the thing. YOU want a career in data science. Great.... me too. But we are in the extreme minority. The companies paying your salary are interested in results. And those need to be hefty. If you are working for ¬£50k and your company is working on a 25% margin, they need ¬£200,000 of value out of you just to break even.
So... your work is not about the work itself. It's about the OUTCOMES of the work. Make sure when you get asked the interview questions that you are ALWAYS thinking ""whats the end result here?"" and answer that... not just the specific question
""The best algorithm to use in <this case> is X"" ... bad answer
""The best algorithm to use in <this case> is X because of A, B C"" - good answer
""The best algorithm to use in <this case> is X, but it takes a lot of effort, so if we are just exploring a problem I'd probably have a quick check with Y first as it's a 1/2 hour job and will show us the value quickly as a test"" .... amazing answer - consider yourself recuited.
If you are taking online courses like datacamp etc... brilliant. I love to see this. But take the extra 10 hours to do a ""introduction to business basics"" instead or as well - you will leapfrog your peers.
Be Pragmatic
Unless you're working for a tech outfit where data science is their bread and butter, then the task is Getting Stuff Done. FIND YOUR STAKEHOLDER SOME VALUE.
be ready to talk about prototypes. Failing fast. Iteration. Be ready to say ""I don't know but I'd be thinking about X, Y and Z"". How can you take a big problem and break it down into a bunch of small quick tests to see if you are on the right track?
Keep telling me that bad data is death.
The killer of all data science, and the constant frustation of your end users is that bad data wrecks models. I know this... I do this for a living. I *hope* you know this. I really *want* you to know this, but you need to tell me. More than once.
""How would you do X?"" - ""I'd do a PCA and then a quick d/tree to get a view of it"" .... meh... ok
""How would you do X?"" - I'd do a PCA and see if the results seem logical - if they don't then I'd go ask someone to have a look otherwise i'm wasting my time - then I'd do a quick d/tree"" - amazing. AMAZING. Consider yourself the reciepient of a new office pass.
""I Don't Know But......"" gets you almost as many, or sometimes even more points than ""I know this""
Remember that unless you are going for the ¬£100k+ roles you are not assumed to know everything. What worries a hiring manager - a LOT - is someone who can't see their gaps. You are the guys that cause us chaos.
Not knowing the answer in an interview is OK IF you pull it back.
""What's your experience with SVM Classifiers?"" - ""nothing - sorry"" .... ok.. maybe you lose some points
""Whats your experience with SVM Classifers?"" - ""I've heard they are hard and a bit twitchy. If I needed to learn them I'd spend a couple of evenings before hand playing at home with the Iris dataset and SciKit to get a feel for them - so at the moment my experience is low but I think I'd be useful with them in the space of a few days"" - boom - amazing.
Data prep, data prep, data prep
You will spend WAY more of your time doing data prep than actual coding and data science work. A Data Science job is, really, cursing at messy data, fixing messy data and then doing a bit of other stuff along the edges.
Show me you can do it. Show me that you can fix up some data in a data frame. Show me you know why a one hot is important. Show me that you have the basics of SQL.
And if I don't bring it up in the interview - force it into the conversation with me.
Lastly...
Ask me questions. It doesn't matter what - you can literally make them up on the spot or have a handful of questions you use for lots of interviews.. but ask me questions - plural. Partly it's something I'm looking for as part of the interview itself. But partly - it makes you more human. It makes you seem engaged and excited. Ask me HARD questions.... ""Whats the biggest problem you guys have had in the last year?"" ""Whats the biggest challenge I'll find when I join?"" ""What do you wish was different about your data group?""
This was a lot of words.... if anyone has any specific questions then post them and I'll try and respond","<div class=""md""><p>Here‚Äôs the original post that inspired the harmonic meme (sorry about the formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile)</p>

Lastly for context - I pay pretty well - top half of the salary band for the north of england, so this is not about &quot;scraping the bottom of the barrel&quot;
The Basics
-- Wash. Brush your hair. Wear a shirt or a blouse. Smile. Talk about something when we meet - &quot;how was your weekend&quot;... I&#39;m a human. Breathe.
When you get the job, unless you work at a fancy bank then no one cares what you look like - but it&#39;s about playing the game. And the game is &quot;I know the rules of an interview&quot;. A ¬£10 shirt will get you more points than a ¬£100 tshirt.
-- Women - you are (slightly) already winning
A lot is made of women in Data Science. And thats great, it&#39;s a great career. But the reality is that both myself and pretty much all the people in my position automatically assume that a woman is slightly better than an equivilant guy and certainly slightly more pragmatic. Don&#39;t worry about the gender thing - you are already very slightly ahead... we WANT the pragmatic and the sensible. Rockstars are a pain in the backside.
The three best hires of my life were all female data scienstists. 5 of the top 10 data scientists in the UK and maybe the world at the moment are female. Just be you.
The Tougher Stuff.
-- Guys.... you have to know your maths
Data Science is about &quot;Getting Sh** done&quot; - it&#39;s NOT ENOUGH to know a few algorithms and a bit of python and want in on a job. Being REALLY brutal.... I can pick up a regular python developer with 3 years dev experience and have them learn some algorithms and they would be more productive than someone who&#39;s in the &quot;pet algorithm camp&quot;.
You NEED to know your maths. Stats especially - you need REALLY good stats.. And when I say that I do not at all mean <em>advanced</em> stats... I mean &quot;rock solid general stats&quot;. All the basic stuff that gets glossed over. Why are we using a normal distribution when this is an Alpha skew? Why are you using a linear regression for a dynamic system? I need you to know a harmonic mean and when to use it. I really need you to be aware of things like a birthday paradox becuase every manager that you ever help out will NOT know it. Fundementals will ALWAYS beat a nice algorithm.
Biases
Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/5 of the work you get asked to do will be flat out stupid. Mostly because of biases and nonsense thinking. Wikipedia&#39;s &quot;list of biases&quot; page is amazing. It will save you more time, get you more promotions and save your employer more time than you will EVER achieve with a tweak to a codebase. Go devour it, and then TELL ME WHEN I&#39;M BEING DUMB.
&quot;Here is a nice answer&quot; gets you good points in an interview
&quot;Here is a nice answer... but you need to be careful about X&quot; gives you huge points in an answer
Be Fanatical about money
Heres the thing. YOU want a career in data science. Great.... me too. But we are in the extreme minority. The companies paying your salary are interested in results. And those need to be hefty. If you are working for ¬£50k and your company is working on a 25% margin, they need ¬£200,000 of value out of you just to break even.
So... your work is not about the work itself. It&#39;s about the OUTCOMES of the work. Make sure when you get asked the interview questions that you are ALWAYS thinking &quot;whats the end result here?&quot; and answer that... not just the specific question
&quot;The best algorithm to use in &lt;this case&gt; is X&quot; ... bad answer
&quot;The best algorithm to use in &lt;this case&gt; is X because of A, B C&quot; - good answer
&quot;The best algorithm to use in &lt;this case&gt; is X, but it takes a lot of effort, so if we are just exploring a problem I&#39;d probably have a quick check with Y first as it&#39;s a 1/2 hour job and will show us the value quickly as a test&quot; .... amazing answer - consider yourself recuited.
If you are taking online courses like datacamp etc... brilliant. I love to see this. But take the extra 10 hours to do a &quot;introduction to business basics&quot; instead or as well - you will leapfrog your peers.
Be Pragmatic
Unless you&#39;re working for a tech outfit where data science is their bread and butter, then the task is Getting Stuff Done. FIND YOUR STAKEHOLDER SOME VALUE.
be ready to talk about prototypes. Failing fast. Iteration. Be ready to say &quot;I don&#39;t know but I&#39;d be thinking about X, Y and Z&quot;. How can you take a big problem and break it down into a bunch of small quick tests to see if you are on the right track?
Keep telling me that bad data is death.
The killer of all data science, and the constant frustation of your end users is that bad data wrecks models. I know this... I do this for a living. I <em>hope</em> you know this. I really <em>want</em> you to know this, but you need to tell me. More than once.
&quot;How would you do X?&quot; - &quot;I&#39;d do a PCA and then a quick d/tree to get a view of it&quot; .... meh... ok
&quot;How would you do X?&quot; - I&#39;d do a PCA and see if the results seem logical - if they don&#39;t then I&#39;d go ask someone to have a look otherwise i&#39;m wasting my time - then I&#39;d do a quick d/tree&quot; - amazing. AMAZING. Consider yourself the reciepient of a new office pass.
&quot;I Don&#39;t Know But......&quot; gets you almost as many, or sometimes even more points than &quot;I know this&quot;
Remember that unless you are going for the ¬£100k+ roles you are not assumed to know everything. What worries a hiring manager - a LOT - is someone who can&#39;t see their gaps. You are the guys that cause us chaos.
Not knowing the answer in an interview is OK IF you pull it back.
&quot;What&#39;s your experience with SVM Classifiers?&quot; - &quot;nothing - sorry&quot; .... ok.. maybe you lose some points
&quot;Whats your experience with SVM Classifers?&quot; - &quot;I&#39;ve heard they are hard and a bit twitchy. If I needed to learn them I&#39;d spend a couple of evenings before hand playing at home with the Iris dataset and SciKit to get a feel for them - so at the moment my experience is low but I think I&#39;d be useful with them in the space of a few days&quot; - boom - amazing.
Data prep, data prep, data prep
You will spend WAY more of your time doing data prep than actual coding and data science work. A Data Science job is, really, cursing at messy data, fixing messy data and then doing a bit of other stuff along the edges.
Show me you can do it. Show me that you can fix up some data in a data frame. Show me you know why a one hot is important. Show me that you have the basics of SQL.
And if I don&#39;t bring it up in the interview - force it into the conversation with me.
Lastly...
Ask me questions. It doesn&#39;t matter what - you can literally make them up on the spot or have a handful of questions you use for lots of interviews.. but ask me questions - plural. Partly it&#39;s something I&#39;m looking for as part of the interview itself. But partly - it makes you more human. It makes you seem engaged and excited. Ask me HARD questions.... &quot;Whats the biggest problem you guys have had in the last year?&quot; &quot;Whats the biggest challenge I&#39;ll find when I join?&quot; &quot;What do you wish was different about your data group?&quot;
This was a lot of words.... if anyone has any specific questions then post them and I&#39;ll try and respond</p>

* 30% - Building an experimentation platform to enable product feed tests (Google PLA, Pinterest, Bing, basically any ad platform where we syndicate a list of products for advertisement).

You‚Äôll roll out the change to certain geo areas (states) and not others, then measure the difference in whatever metrics you care about. The matched market part is how you divide your states into a test and control group. 

There are basically two ways you can do matching. You can do 1:1 matching of geos or you do some weighted matching where the test and control group approximate one another at an aggregate level. 1:1 matching is called matched pairs and is generally a little more robust to noisy data. If you have an outlier geo, you can simply exclude the pair from the test without biasing your results. However with this method you‚Äôre limited to a 50/50 split. 

Matching at an aggregate level gives you a little more flexibility in your data split and can handle smaller numbers of geos since your measurement unit is essentially the time period instead of the geo itself. However it can be affected more by noisy data and relies on having a longer stable preperiod.","<div class=""md""><p>It is helpful, thanks!

1334,save_the_panda_bears,"Repurposing a comment I made about the entry level data science market because I feel like there are quite a few similarities.

The labor market for entry level marketing is a bit of a mess right now. There are several things working against entry level candidates.

1. Strategic marketing isn't really an entry level role. It's a field that requires pretty heavy domain knowledge, which is something that you can really only get with hands on experience. 

2. Hiring a junior marketer has two costs to a business - the cost of employing the junior marketer and the opportunity cost required from the rest of the team to train them. Teams are already pretty strapped for resources, so this training cost is non-negligible. It's an investment most firms are not willing to make at the moment when there are quite a few experienced marketers looking for work out there right now. 

3. Companies are realizing that what they need is marketing automation or people to build out the marketing infrastructure and not necessarily marketers.

4. Since COVID the number of people transitioning into a marketing related career has grown seemingly exponentially with the proliferation of master programs, micromasters, online courses, and bootcamps. There's a larger supply of entry level candidates relative to 3-4 years ago. 

5. Marketing related jobs are usually remote friendly, so you're now competing with a countrywide talent pool.

6. There's this really interesting bit of an arms race/game theory coordination failure happening between HR departments and applicants. Right now the general strategy entry level applicants seem to be taking is to apply to any and every job available in hopes that something will stick. In a perfect world, there would be an equal number of jobs and candidates, with HR having the ability to select the best candidate for a given role. However, that's not the case. We have an instability where supply of candidates seems to exceed the number of roles available and there simply isn't enough time for HR to review every resume. It takes HR time to go through resumes, and in that time, the candidates are applying to other jobs (often in an automated fashion), increasing the global amount of time required for HR filter through applications. So we end up in this cycle where it takes more applications on average to get a job and HR is forced to use increasingly stringent filtering criteria to select candidates since time is finite.","<div class=""md""><p>Repurposing a comment I made about the entry level data science market because I feel like there are quite a few similarities.</p>

1355,save_the_panda_bears,"Pricing is a really interesting problem full of idiosyncrasies and irrational behavior. People dedicate their whole careers to figure out pricing problems. 

As /u/dennis9f mentioned, the particular case you mentioned is what economists recognize as a Veblen Good - a perceived luxury good whose demand increases as price increases as a function of perceived quality or status. However, this effect isn't necessarily limited to only luxury goods. There are cases when lower quality products exhibit the same behavior, economists call these Giffen goods. A good example of Giffen goods are things like staple foods. Generally people living on low income consume high amounts of staple foods, and if the price of these staple goods rises, demand increases since these people can no longer afford to purchase other things.

Back to your original question. One thing you may want to consider is the interaction effect your pricing decision has on the purchase of other goods. People love to make decisions by measuring the value relative to other things. Middle option bias is a real thing, especially if people don't have a great baseline for the appropriate price of an item. There are cases where you can generate more revenue from your higher profit margins items just by putting an option out there priced higher. People never actually have to buy this item, but just by having it as an option causes people to drift to the middle priced option, which is where you can price your highest margin items.","<div class=""md""><p>Pricing is a really interesting problem full of idiosyncrasies and irrational behavior.

I actually have it repasted twice and I am quite sure that I did a good job on that. I guess that the heatsinks/heatpipes are bad. I don't know, but it was way cooler and less throttling before they changed my motherboard.
As for VRM pads placement, I stacked them until they reach the case cover.

Anyway just today I was able to reduce the previous horrible ~92C to ~89C after tightening the screws around the heatsink and also undervolted -125 which fortunately stable. Still I don't like this high temperature on my CPU so I will repaste again until I find a desirable temperature.

No it doesn't come with a new heatsink and they repasted with their standard dell paste. Their paste job was horrible (which I mention initially the CPU temp can reach 96C) so I decided to repaste it again using my Grizzly Kyronaut.
Yeah actually the screws came with this computer are very soft , I once stripped one that holds the battery.

Well, the next day he started walking sideways. He always had severe arthritis but this day it was particularly bad. He still wanted to go to the park, so we went for a short 10ish minute walk.

When we got back home he was in visible pain. Running around in circles, his legs constantly giving out, urinating, he could not lie down. His pain medicine did not help, and this continued for 45 minutes before I decided it was time.

I took him to the Emergency Vet and asked for their opinion. She said she believed it was time too. It was done, peaceful, but I feel so guilty and awful. Maybe he could have gotten a little better? Maybe he had a few more days? Should I have even taken him to the park one last time?

I had to cut out anything overhead, so overhead press was a no go for me. I didn't start working on my shoulders again directly until just a few months ago.

1465,tits_mcgee_92,"Hey! I was diagnosed with that, degenerative discs, etc throughout my C2-C6 when I was 25. I'm almost 31 now and doing really good, but I went through a year of torture with the pain. Keep in mind, back when I was 25 my condition was considered ""mild"", but that that just means the progression of the condition, and doesn't indicate a person's pain level.

So yeah, there's no cure, but it can be managed. Managed in such a way that it can just be background noise in your life, or you may not even notice it at all. Everyone is different. Here are the methods that worked for me.

- Physical Therapy. Neck muscles, trap muscles, etc. This will help strengthen those muscles supporting the neck and hopefully help alleviate pain. I have been doing them every day for 6 years now.

- Exercising. I had to completely change my strength training regime, but it's fine and I have found things that work for me. When I am NOT active, or hunched over at my desk all day, it really hurts.

- Anti inflammatory foods. Seriously, this has helped tons. If I ever have a big sugar binge or eat unhealthy, I'm pretty much screwed.

- I take ibuprofen on bad flare up days, but your doctor may prescribe you something else.

- People talk about stem cell injections and future medicine that are in the works. It is highly controversial, and not at all regulated in the United States, so I cannot speak on that much.

Trying to time up a lease vs purchase is tricky. I‚Äôd start researching now and understanding, historically, is their housing stock in your price range regularly on the market?

To give a time frame on closing- from offer accepted to money exchanging hands took 45 days- but this time frame is negotiable (time it took my wife and I to find a house we liked....8 months).

I know I just said you‚Äôll start looking closer to the time your lease runs up...but start going to open houses NOW. Every one is a learning experience. You‚Äôll see things you never thought you‚Äôd love, or hate, and just get used to the process.

With the muzzle i am a bit cautious of how the dog would be perceived/treated, but ultimately i think it'd be the only way to guarantee nothing bad would happen.

2108,niujin,"Fingerprints of identical twins are more similar than the fingerprints of two random strangers, or of two fraternal siblings. But they are still not exactly the same.

That is because fingerprint patterns are influenced by two factors: genetics and environmental influence in the womb.

A foetus' webbed hands divide into fingers by 2 months, and fingerprints are fully formed by 6 months of gestation. The patterns are influenced partly by the fingers touching each other and the surroundings, which is a scenario that will vary between the twins.

> The chance that the fingerprints have the same type from identical twins is 0.7440, comparing to 0.3215 from non-identical twins.

2109,niujin,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is getting computers to use and understand human language and speech, such as English, French or another ""natural language"". For example:

* Any voice recognition, speech synthesis, or question answering program like Siri. You can speak to a computer and it understands your voice.
* a computer program that reads company reports or health records in plain English and produces numbers from them (e.g. profit this quarter).
*  if you upload your CV/resume to a job site sometimes it will automatically get your name and past employers from the document and fill out a form, even though different people could have formatted the document differently.
* Google Translate
* a search engine like Google which gives you documents when you type a word into the search box. Note that when you search for *cat*, Google will give you documents containing *cats* and even *feline*.

Note that for the last example, an engineer will have given Google's software the information about English synonyms and English plural patterns.

Natural Language Processing is a kind of Artificial Intelligence. If you want to build an NLP program you can start writing rules like ""ignore an s on the end of a word"". This is the old school way of doing things and it's called the ""rule based"" approach.

However the more advances techniques use machine learning, where you program your computer to learn patterns in English.

I found it very useful and easy to adapt to my needs (regression, recommendations, text classification). I would recommend this over an RNN approach because you do not need to do anything on sequence level.

If you want to train a model to predict how people triage things, you need to decide on a few things:

* Is it trained only for a specific set of users? Or will more users be added/removed as time goes on?
* Do users belong to categories (tech support, front end developers, etc)?
* Is it enough to predict that someone will forward to a given team?
* Or do you want to do the hardest version of this task which is to train a model on a few sets of users within a company, and try to deploy it for a completely different company?

The latter would be quite interesting, maybe you could try to train the CNN to give you a doc2vec of each bug description.

The model that you train will definitely not be more accurate than your hand built method. In fact it's quite possible that your model will simply learn the rule based method that you used to label the data in the first place, which defeats the purpose of doing machine learning.

If you are getting a ""high accuracy"" from your rule based method, that sounds like it's not 100%. So if you train an ML model on a training set that is itself only 90% accurate, I would not put money on the final model exceeding 90% accuracy.

I think it would be best to use your rule based method but allow it to output a ""needs manual checking"" option. So it could label 90% of examples without human intervention, and the ones that it's unsure about you could label manually. That would allow you to benefit from the labour saving and still get a 100% accurate train and validation set.

(As an aside from this, depending on your ML architecture it's possible that it will pick up on a feature that your rule based method wasn't sophisticated enough to see. For example if you are doing image classification with CNNs, you may find that your model ends up being better than whatever rule based method you used to assign things to categories, however I wouldn't count on this. You could also look into bootstrapping where you use the rule based method to label some examples, train a model on those, and use it to label more examples, however this is quite hard to do.

I will check the bioinformatics subreddit.

You're right, gender is a nonsensical idea because it's in the chromosomes. I didn't think of that (long time since I left school) but it shows how little I know about this stuff.

So if sequencing DNA doesn't just produce a long string, what does it produce?

When I go to the mitochondrial DNA page I linked, and click on one example, Canary Islands, it starts:

```
GATCACAGGTCTATCACCCTATTAACCACTC...
```

so somehow they have got to this string. From your answer it sounds like there would be other data that the sequencing process produced as well?

One of my ideas is, because a CNN is really good at picking up patterns and classifying natural language texts, is to apply a CNN in TensorFlow on these mitochondrial DNA strings and make a simple classifier... you input a new mitochondrial genome sequence and you get an output like 60% Northern European etc. Ideally I would have 100x more data but I've got to work with what I've got.

2159,niujin,"OK thanks for the comments. I looked around the main providers' websites and found the easiest way to compare prices is to look at hourly prices for K80 GPU, because all providers offer it.

I'll share what I found in case this is useful for anyone else:

In the UK the hourly prices for K80:

* Google Cloud Platform - $0.49/hour

* Amazon EC2 (including NVIDIA Cloud) - $0.97/hour

* Microsoft Azure - ¬£0.87/hour

There are some variations in the pricing model. For example Amazon offers cheaper prices if you are flexible with your timings and happy to run when demand is low. As far as I could tell OVH only has a monthly charge and no way to pay hourly.

On the more expensive end, there is the Volta GPU which is only offered by Amazon.

In terms of usability of setting it up, Amazon was the easiest, whereas navigating through Google's website was quite tricky.","<div class=""md""><p>OK thanks for the comments.

2165,niujin,"OK for your calculation 1, you need a machine learning algorithm that allows you to look inside. So random forest doesn't help a huge amount there.

First of all I would make a scatter plot of the independent vs dependent variable, for each indep and each dep. variable. This should let you visualise what the relationships are between them, as some variables may have a complex non-linear relationship. I have used Weka which is a useful tool that lets you load the data in CSV form and produces a matrix of scatter plots.

Next you can normalise your independent variables so they have a similar range (e.g. -1 to 1) or similar standard deviation. I'd suggest also applying any other sensible processing if it looks like something has a non-linear dependency.

Then you can train a model such as sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression, and call get_params() to see the weights it's assigned to the different parameters. This will give numbers to what you have already seen in the scatter plots, namely that some independent variables are strong predictors for isAttempted etc, and some are weaker.","<div class=""md""><p>OK for your calculation 1, you need a machine learning algorithm that allows you to look inside.

2166,niujin,"This is a regression problem, however your Suicide Attempt Severity Score seems a little arbitrary as it's not based on a linear scale in the real world. Perhaps I would suggest to split it up into a few boolean values such as isAttempted, isViolent, isSucceeded? You can easily convert between these boolean values and your Score.

If you do that, then your problem is condensed down to 3 binary classification problems.

* Input: age, weight, mental health score, physical health score

* Output: isAttempted etc

You could try first with a simple logistic regression. However this would not work well because the probability of committing suicide will not be a linear function of weight etc. (By the way, do you have BMI? that might be more informative).

So I would suggest to use a random forest classifier to predict the 0-1 values that you want.

Here's an example in Scikit-learn: https://medium.com/machine-learning-101/chapter-5-random-forest-classifier-56dc7425c3e1

An alternative would be a SVM, which is also easily done in Scikit-learn. However I found random forest easier to work with for this kind of problem.

Yet another alternative to random forest, which would perform worse in my opinion, would be to still use logistic regression, but transform your input features manually, e.g. weight transformed as a Z-score compared to mean and std.dev weight of the population, and the square of this Z-score, etc.

While dbt isn't ""revolutionary,"" it is far better than the alternatives I have seen them use:

* Visual ETL tools: No CI/CD, No code reviews, expensive, proprietary, limited only to IT
* Custom frameworks: Only as good as what was built for the initial project. Unless it is a tech type of enterprise like Google / Apple, etc. Most companies don't have the talent nor spend the resources to not only create, but maintain and improve their platform over time.
* DDL / DMLs: Users create some files and if we are lucky, put them in git, but promotion to prod is manual or if we are lucky using some tool like Flyway. However, there is no development nor test isolation. Raw data is different between dev/test/prd. Dev is done with a subset of data, the test environment has data that hasnt been refreshed in months and ""real"" testing happens after deployment because that is when the data is available.

I can go on, but that's a high level.

On the other hard, this is what dbt allows:

* DAG from code. You dont start with a visual tool, but you get lineage
* Optimal for CI/CD and code reviews: simple to see what was actually changed in a PR
* No vendor lock-in: Open source
* Large community: 50+k people on the dbt Slack alone
* Transferable skills: many companies, large and small and adopting dbt
* dbt is becoming the de-facto standard for integrating between tools, even Matillion now supports dbt
* VS Code extension, dbt packages and dbt libraries: there a many of these and they keep growing. If you find you need something with dbt, it is likely someone else faced the same issue and solved and released something for it.
* The framework matures without you doing anything: I have been using dbt since 2020 and it that time I have benefitted from the updates to it. We can focus on data, not the framework
* Idenpotency: Don't underestimate this. Gone are the days of a different PK for a customer table in dev, test, prd.
* Build and test with real data: By using slim CI and deferral, it's possible with point to prd data dynamically from any environment.
* Single tool across the org. Due to it's simplicity and lower cost, it is now possible to have a single tool across IT and the business.

As you said, the hardest problem is not the tech, it is the process and it's governance. In the dbt community you get to interact and learn from others and when done well with CI/CD etc, it can scale well. I know several large enterprises using dbt and the main thing it gives them is a starting point that is more mature than anything they are doing or could build.

I can go on about the benefits of dbt, but I'll stop here. We need to consider all the factors that have made dbt so popular, not just the technology itself.

However, if I do the main transformation in dbt and create marts specific to the users then that same user can connect excel and do the ""last mile"" analytics with excel or alterix, at that point it is something very specific to them so it is not as crucial. by doing things in dbt I can set up CI/CD as well and I can reduce redundancy in the whole process.

So, in the end, there is a place for both and using either approach for everything may not work, so finding the right use case and users for each is what I would recommend.","<div class=""md""><p>I dont know if the decision is between notebooks and low code OR some sort of text based &quot;code&quot; vs low/no-code</p>

3. Use dbt for transformation, data quality, and documentation

5. Use an orchestrator like Airflow if you need to run your custom extract scripts

Essentially yes, but everyone has different levels of hunger, and habits, and activity levels, which all make a big difference. But if you're finding that now, it's not going to change for the better unless you do something about it. There are SOME things you can do about it:

-Build some muscle. Muscle does burn more calories than fat at rest, but it's not that huge of an effect. More importantly, having some muscle in your frame makes you look better at any given bodyweight. People who've never lifted a weight tend to feel like they need to be ""skinny"" to look good. And for a lot of people that means getting down to an unsustainable body weight.

-Improve habits. Sounds like you're already working on this. But calories from snacks add up so quickly it's unreal.

-increase activity levels. Set yourself a minimum step count, walk more. Possibly look into physical hobby's you can do regularly, but the step count is the #1 low impact easy to implement tip.

Lastly, don't worry about other people and what they do/don't have to do. None of it affects your body, if you want your body to change (or stay the same with less effort or whatever) it's only you that can do anything about it.

Welcome /u/edger154! Thanks for choosing r/DirtyKIKRoleplay! 

To make sure all posts have enough detail in them for other users we have a minimum character limit. To repost this you're going to have to write and add more content. 

But don't worry! We suggest you take a little time to look at other people's posts on the sub and see if you can pick up a few pointers or ideas for what to add to your post. 

The three most common things missing are kinks, limits, and most importantly a story, or prompt. It's something that should be roughly a paragraph that sets up the kind of story you'd like your character to playout with others. If you're not sure what to write there are tons of ideas here to look through for inspiration. Just remember not to plagiarize or copy someone else's post. Write your own!

Once you've done that go ahead and try to repost. 

 Good luck and if you have any questions, that aren't about what the limit is, feel free to message the mods!

your ban will remain (without even a consideration).

1. Motive for use: You need ORg'S buy in to create coherent goals and asks to report against these goals - without them, there is no strong motive to use data.  
2. Means: Provide documentation, and simple tools for the usage paradigm. Metabase for example has documentation and pivot-table interface for business users - Tableau otoh is analyst centric and does not support democratisation.  
3. Ability - Train, train train. Track that people are using, if not send them back to training. Make training a systemic organisation onboarding thing.

3770,Thinker_Assignment,"Thanks for the feedback!

All used data is structured, but all data produced is semi-structured. Using semi structured data directly makes implicit assumptions about structure and is thus error prone.

For this reason, we all need to structure data into Parquet, or DBs, to make using it robust, and discovering it explicit.

dlt is a library to achieve this in the simplest way possible - with automation and declarative interface.

dlt is the first library that automates this transition, complete with

* Column name normalisation so your data just automagically fits in db
* 1- liner with declarative write disposition - declare which field in your json
* alerts and metadata for the schemas
* schema versioning which can be used later for column/row level lineage.
* generic way to load to any db of the supported ones - no learning curve.

So in short, if you want to build any robust data application, you can either spend a tedious amount of time converting strings to dates, unpacking jsons etc and produce breakable code, 4-16h effort.  


OR you could pass your json to dlt and let it work instead of you -  5-10min effort.   


No more memory overflows, schema changes causing breakages, or surprise field changes. And no more maintenance effort and dirty data.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

<li>Column name normalisation so your data just automagically fits in db</li>
<li>1- liner with declarative write disposition - declare which field in your json</li>
<li>alerts and metadata for the schemas</li>
<li>schema versioning which can be used later for column/row level lineage.</li>
<li>generic way to load to any db of the supported ones - no learning curve.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in short, if you want to build any robust data application, you can either spend a tedious amount of time converting strings to dates, unpacking jsons etc and produce breakable code, 4-16h effort.  </p>

<p>OR you could pass your json to dlt and let it work instead of you -  5-10min effort.   </p>

<p>No more memory overflows, schema changes causing breakages, or surprise field changes. And no more maintenance effort and dirty data.</p>

Applying software engineering practices to data engineering tasks can lead to inefficiencies and complications. While software engineering and data engineering share some similarities, they also have distinct differences that require different approaches and tools. 

For instance, data engineering often involves dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data, schema evolution, incremental loading, and other unique challenges. Therefore, it might be beneficial for your team to explore data engineering-specific tools and practices. These could include traditional ETL tools, data pipeline orchestration tools, and data modeling practices.

4187,madhav1113,"Hi there. I'm the OP.

Have you found something interesting (either theoretical or directional)?

I realized that I love theoretical work a lot but I also need to put food on my table. Secondly, I was on a career break for 3-4 months because of physical and mental health issues. Now I'm kinda back in the job market but I've stopped applying to every generic data science role out there. Interviewers have asked me almost everything from pulling data, SQL queries, ..., transformer models, deploying models on cloud etc. I'm just too damn tired of all of this.

I've stopped applying to generic DS roles for now and am focusing on getting better at computer vision and deep learning. I love mechanics, 3D vision and robotics, and deep learning on graphs \[I know, these are quite different from each other\] so I'm trying to pivot to companies that do that kind of work. So far I've not been very successful but I'll try for some more time.

Once I have enough money in my bank account, my dream is to quit industry and do a PhD in mathematics (geometry). I don't know if that's possible or not but there's no harm in wishful thinking. A useful consequence of wishful thinking is that my love for geometry has made me appreciate and understand 3D computer vision and robotics a lot more.

Phew!! that was a lot of words!! Hope you're doing well in your life.","<div class=""md""><p>Hi there. I&#39;m the OP.</p>

\- Try to understand taxes, stock market, mutual funds and related ideas in depth and start investing seriously.

\- Diversify my portfolio (but not too much that it becomes a mess to handle). Invest enough for short, medium and long term.

**Scary goal #2:**

\- Quit my job and switch careers-  I am very interested in these areas- robotics, autonomous vehicles, optical systems (think of cameras, microscopes etc), virtual reality, computer vision/AI.

My goal is to just get better, stay consistent and move forward. I'm also aiming for a six pack but that's just a side goal. My main aim is to have a healthy body.

\- Meditate daily, starting with 10 minutes a day.

4235,madhav1113,"Hi OP

My situation is somewhat similar to yours. I hate what I'm doing in data science right now. I have about 8 YOE (7 YOE in image processing and computer vision). To try things for ""fun"", I pivoted to applying ML in financial problems- One of the worst decisions of my life. My pay is good, I have a good work life balance but I don't feel motivated to do even the most basic shit (the bare minimum).

Here is what I have learned so far (in a short span of 1 year) about myself. Apologies in advance about the long post.

&#x200B;

1. If I am trading 8 hours of my time everyday for my work, it better be in something that excites me.
2. I totally understand that not everyone finds meaning in work. But I do. I like to solve problems that I care about.
3. I don't care about any ML model (be it simple linear regression or the latest version of transformers) as long as it solves the problem of interest.
4. I love mathematics and physics. I did my undergrad in geospatial sciences/engineering, and my masters in satellite systems engineering (my courses were geared towards sensors, communication systems, optics, lasers etc for space systems).

<p>My situation is somewhat similar to yours. I hate what I&#39;m doing in data science right now. I have about 8 YOE (7 YOE in image processing and computer vision). To try things for &quot;fun&quot;, I pivoted to applying ML in financial problems- One of the worst decisions of my life. My pay is good, I have a good work life balance but I don&#39;t feel motivated to do even the most basic shit (the bare minimum).</p>

<p>Here is what I have learned so far (in a short span of 1 year) about myself. Apologies in advance about the long post.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ol>
<li>If I am trading 8 hours of my time everyday for my work, it better be in something that excites me.</li>
<li>I totally understand that not everyone finds meaning in work. But I do. I like to solve problems that I care about.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t care about any ML model (be it simple linear regression or the latest version of transformers) as long as it solves the problem of interest.</li>
<li>I love mathematics and physics. I did my undergrad in geospatial sciences/engineering, and my masters in satellite systems engineering (my courses were geared towards sensors, communication systems, optics, lasers etc for space systems). I am going back to my undergraduate and graduate courses/books and studying them in my free time. I&#39;ve started with a remote sensing course on Coursera. I&#39;m familiar with most of the content (it&#39;s mostly image processing/ML applied to satellite images). Also, I love proving theorems in real analysis, linear algebra and other math areas.

4236,madhav1113,"I'm pretty sure that I don't want to do data science for the rest of my life. I don't have an exit strategy right now, but I'm confident to have a proper plan in a couple of months.

I like building things too. I worked on cool satellite building projects as part of my MS thesis in  grad school. Best time of my life!!

Having said all that, I hate statistical modeling (even though I am good at math). I don't care about XGBoost or the latest SOTA model in NLP. These days, I'm more interested in building pipelines, writing good code, learning functional programming on the fly and software architecture principles. Of course, I'm trying to understand how my computer works as well. The joy of building a good pipeline is immense.

Note- I'm not talking about sophisticated pipelines used in ML or AI. Even something as simple as a shell script to retrain a model every week is good enough to bring a smile on my face. 

I'm thinking of a PhD in applied math (stuff like nonlinear dynamics, chaos) or engineering/applied physics. Building a product is pretty exciting than doing statistical modeling. 

As far as impact is concerned, it's not an important metric for me. But I do spend 9-10 hours everyday on my job and I'd rather do the things I like/care about. I know that not all days will be good or productive but I do aim for maximizing my job satisfaction everyday, if possible. For months, it has been decaying almost rapidly. I don't like that.

I am surprised, though, to hear you suggest CPU paralllelization would perform better. I'm trying to understand why? I think the parallelized function is calculating the likelihood at each observation. Assuming STAN supports the function on a GPU, and the function can be parallelized (i.e. the likelihood of one observation is independent of that of another) there should, *in theory*, be gains in the number of cores up to the number of observations (e.g. one core per observation max). That could be supported on a GPU, but not a CPU. Sounds like I'm missing something?

4291,Interesting_Passion,"I think there are many ways to benefit from MDMA therapy, and inner-child / parts work is a great one. Funny enough, I didn't used to think that way. I used to think the idea of an inner-child was too woo woo. That was until my [second session](https://old.reddit.com/r/mdmatherapy/comments/r1jnv8/my_second_journey_meeting_my_inner_child/) introduced me to mine. I've since spent a lot of time studying Internal Family Systems (IFS), practicing it on myself, and practicing it with others. 

According to IFS, our child-like parts get stuck at a time of 'trauma' -- when stress exceeds one's ability to cope. Children don't have the same capacity for stress as adults; they depend on others. A 'traumatic' experience could be as simple as being left alone at a time of need. And thus, a 'part' is born. 

IFS is one way to engage with our inner child, and MDMA can make this interaction very vivid. I've seen this in myself, others, and the many similar stories in this sub. Often times that inner child just wants to be witnessed. They didn't have that adult at the time, and now you have the opportunity to be there for them. 

I recommend the book 'Self Therapy' by Jay Earley (it gets recommended here often). It's very comprehensive of the IFS model, but also very readable. But I would especially highlight his emphasis on the steps -- toward the back of the book -- on healing. It's necessary but not sufficient to simply 'access' one's inner child; there are steps that need to be completed, in order, to help the part. For that reason -- and somewhat contrary to the point of Earley's book -- I think it helps to have a guided session. The time with MDMA is very brief, and a second person can help keep the session focused on completing the steps. 

Nothing but encouragement from me!

I did MDMA first -- and would recommend the same to anyone else in similar boat. The idea is to use the safety of MDMA to explore the panic. Where does it come from? Why is it there?

Two points worth mentioning up front if you decide to pursue this. First, this isn't the type of treatment where you take two pills and call your doctor in the morning. MDMA creates a window of opportunity within which it's up to you to use that time wisely. Second, it can be rough going sometimes.

4310,Interesting_Passion,"I have a few thoughts:

* Psilocybin was advanced for the treatment of depression, not MDMA. The latter was advanced to treat PTSD (e.g. flashback, intrusive thoughts, nightmares). They have different mechanisms of action that explain why. That doesn't mean MDMA can't help, but consider your options. 

* There is conflicting evidence if/when MDMA can make depression worse in the short term. This is the commonly reported MDMA hangover. Not everyone gets it. Some report an MDMA afterglow. I only point this out because I wouldn't want someone to pursue MDMA in an acute state of despair, without an understanding that things might get worse before they get better. That said, MDMA was not shown to increase suicidality in the MAPS clinical trials. 

* I read two related but distinct issues in your post. The first is the grief from the breakup. Sure, depression makes a lot of sense there. The second is the childhood/attachment stuff.

1. The MAPS clinical trial included only treatment resistant cases of PTSD. IIRC, the average duration of symptoms was about ten years. From anecdotal reports, MAPS screened for the worst of the worst cases. They improved. 

2. A comment from Michael Pollen, when discussing the safety of psychedelics, was that to be included in clinical trials these days requires the participant be seriously, seriously ill. There are no more clinical trials that 'well' people can even get into. 

Obviously, we know the caveats. Participants in those trials were surrounded by therapists; they weren't just given drugs.

4314,Interesting_Passion,"When working with IFS, it is important to both *start* and *finish* with the protectors. By that, I mean don't skip straight to unburdening the exile. Ask the protector for permission to work with the exile first. Then, after the unburdening, ask the protector to inspect your work. This is especially important when working with MDMA, since it's easy to blow right past the protectors. 

From an IFS perspective, the way to help your exiles not feel as overwhelmed is to ask. ""When in doubt, ask."" A typical path is to (1) ask the exile to show you what it would like you to know (aka 'witnessing'). You then (2) ask the exile if you can enter the memory as your adult self, and provide the exile with what it needed at the time. Often times, exiles take on their extreme roles from childhood when there wasn't an adult there to comfort them at the time; when this is the case, simply being there can be enough. But ask. Then (3) ask the exile if they're ready to release the negative energy from the body. You'd be surprised how many times the exile is not ready. So ask. If they are ready, then (4) offer them an unburdening ceremony where they can release the energy into one of the elements (e.g. water, fire, air..).

* How do you envision psychedelic therapy will benefit you differently from your non-therapeudic use of psychoactive drugs? It sounds like you've already done both MDMA and traditional psychedelics. Why do you think this be different?

I think I would rather re-read my notes from the book before I attempt to summarize their work. Their theory is pretty abstract, and the topic is pretty important. I'd prefer to not swing and miss. I think I'd like to do that, though. I'll plan to make that a separate post. I also checked online, and of the resources I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFCQ9NwRARo) is the only one I would consider ""not bad"". 

You raise an interesting point about stepping outside the window of tolerance, and I know from talking with researchers this is a point of debate within the trauma therapy community. As I understand it, there are those in the Peter Levine camp that emphasize ""titration"" and ""pendulation"", like what u/cleerlight and u/YoYoYL mention. But there are those that suggest the opposite: to intentionally [flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_(psychology) the nervous system with distress until it calms down. IIRC, flooding has a high drop-out rate, but also a high success rate among those that see it through. I don't take a side either way. I understand the debate is legitimate. But I do think Raziv's work is in the later camp, and individuals should know there is a choice between the two. 

What helped me was to understand that trauma fragmented my personality into parts. Some of those parts were in such a state of distress they were cutoff -- dissociated -- from my Self. Unfortunately, those parts held important parts of me that once cutoff left me disabled. PSIP would temporarily reintegrate those parts but not calm their distress. Because those parts remained distressed, they would eventually re-dissociate after a few days and I would return to the fog. This might be where you and I differed? MDMA was different in that it not only reintegrated those parts, but helped calmed them down. I had to learn to work with it, though. Early on I was too aggressive. If I reintegrated without calming them, I would destabilize again. That was an easy fix, though. I just had to learn to calm each part down (doable thanks to MDMA) before moving on to the next.

Bhaha... yes. I know. Because I was one of them. I also went deep down the PSIP rabbit hole. To be fair, it did provide relief from dissociation when I was at my worst. But it didn't heal the underlying trauma. It just brought me out of the fog for a few days at the cost of increased anxiety and panic. My hot take is that the PSIP method places all its chips on somatic processing of trauma. That just wasn't cutting it for me. I will say, though, that I learned a lot from it. It really helped me get familiar with my dissociation (which is incredibly hard to notice). I just had to take those skills into my MDMA sessions. That worked. 

The book that eventually structured my thinking around dissociation is [The Haunted Self](https://www.amazon.com/Haunted-Self-Dissociation-Traumatization-Interpersonal/dp/0393704017/ref=sr_1_1?crid=E4SIRWE769RN&keywords=haunted+self&qid=1685647119&sprefix=haunted+self%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc).

* I highly recommend you pick up a copy of Jay Earley's ""Self Therapy"". One of the points he emphasizes is that IFS should always start with and end with the protector; don't skip straight to working with an exile, and don't finish without returning to the protector. You don't even have to work with the exile at all; it's worth spending time with just the protector alone. 

* IFS is great for both intention setting and integration. You don't have to take MDMA to work with these parts. It might even be a good idea to wait to take MDMA again until your parts consent. 

* The IFS framework for working with protectors is called the 6 F's. There are many articles online detailing the steps. 

* Someone posted a really good IFS [chatbot](https://old.reddit.com/r/InternalFamilySystems/comments/11n2e6x/i_made_an_ai_chatbot_that_acts_as_your_ifs/). You can use this tool to sketch out a conversation with your parts. 

* Referencing Jay Earley's book again, he recommends addressing protector concerns about overwhelm by assuring it that you will remain in Self when working with the exile. Dick Shwartz, the founder of IFS, has said several times that overwhelm can be prevented by assuring the exile it will be witnessed if it agrees to step-back and remain unblended. 

* You don't need to heal the exile to access Self. In the IFS model, you always have access to Self.

* You might benefit from going through the IFS steps with other target parts to get the hang of it. You don't *have* to go straight to the big issues right away.

It explains how our childhood experiences in our family of origin affect our relationships as adults. There are other theories that apply, but that's a good one. 

There are some who suggest that pre-verbal trauma like what you say happened at age 1 is healed somatically, which you mention in your post. It could be that was when you were brought there. 

I would be cautious about looking for sexual abuse if it's not already there. MDMA has been known to surface repressed memories; but MDMA has also been known to facilitate false memories. Don't treat it like a solution in search of a problem (""trust, surrender, receive"").

Take time to integrate. Read everything you can; Write down how you understand it applies to you.

4382,Interesting_Passion,"This was explained to me by one of the top published researchers in the clinical treatment of PTSD as common to all treatments, not just MDMA. Treatment must access the underlying fear structure, which is obviously very difficult to work with. It's not uncommon, she said, for patients to get worse before they get better (and she doesn't work with MDMA). This provides an important clue and suggests that methods of integration can be borrowed from other non-MDMA modalities (e.g. IFS, somatic experiencing, EFT, narrative therapy, massage). 

But to address your other point, it is not true that according to clinical trials *all* patients improved after three sessions: Only about 2/3 of patients receiving MDMA no longer met the criteria of PTSD compared to 1/3 of patients receiving therapy only. Furthermore, we know from interviews conducted by the New York Magazine (listen to their podcast Cover Story: Power Trip) that at least a few of those patients receiving MDMA felt their treatment was incomplete, even though they no longer *technically* qualified for PTSD. Like I mentioned above, and consistent with many reports on this sub, I wouldn't want anyone to start work with MDMA thinking it will be all sunshine and roses, and walk away disappointed or in despair if it is not.

4400,bcw28511,"Hi All,  
  
I am currently approaching my 1 year anniversary as an entry-level data analyst at a software company. I joined this company as I was in a pretty desperate situation and due to my lack of options at the time, took a pretty low level income position for the field. I have a bachelors in Statistics and I am currently working on a Master's in Stats/Data Science as I originally wanted to get into Data Science/ML.  
  
Shortly after beginning this position, I realized that it was much more of a intermediary between consulting and data engineering. Instead of true data analysis, I work directly with data engineers and clients to maintain databases and ensure that any changes are successfully completed. Through this, I've gotten very good at using SQL, I am familiar with SSIS for creating packages, and I have a pretty thorough understanding of data normalization, batch-processing, job automation, pipelining, and communication with clients.  
  
Throughout this first year, I have actually come to really enjoy the backend work of a data engineer and as I work through more academic work relating to stats and data science, I find that I am actually not that fond of it. Another thing that I have learned from my company in the first year is that they are not quite willing to fully commit me to either data engineering or to data science roles, instead intending to keep me in this weird consultancy-hybrid position.  
  
Because of this and the low initial salary, i find it pretty clear that this position is a dead-end long term but is a very valuable opportunity for me to learn a lot of skills for my future as a data engineer.  
  
My main intention with this post was to try to seek advice on how to streamline my time here at my current company in order to buff my resume and get me into a position to get hired into a better paid data engineer (or maybe even senior data engineer) position within the next 18-24 months. For example, what sort of concepts should I really be studying, what tools and programming languages do I need to develop skills in, what kind of certs/resume fluff would benefit my job search, etc.  
  
I have applied to a few companies so far with not too much word back and I am taking that as a sign that I need to focus more on developing my skills in my current position.  
  
tl;dr I am a data analyst turned data engineer hoping to maximize opportunity at dead end job to buff resume to get better paying position when the time comes.  
  
Thanks everyone!","<div class=""md""><p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I am currently approaching my 1 year anniversary as an entry-level data analyst at a software company. I joined this company as I was in a pretty desperate situation and due to my lack of options at the time, took a pretty low level income position for the field. I have a bachelors in Statistics and I am currently working on a Master&#39;s in Stats/Data Science as I originally wanted to get into Data Science/ML.</p>

<p>Shortly after beginning this position, I realized that it was much more of a intermediary between consulting and data engineering. Instead of true data analysis, I work directly with data engineers and clients to maintain databases and ensure that any changes are successfully completed. Through this, I&#39;ve gotten very good at using SQL, I am familiar with SSIS for creating packages, and I have a pretty thorough understanding of data normalization, batch-processing, job automation, pipelining, and communication with clients.</p>

<p>Throughout this first year, I have actually come to really enjoy the backend work of a data engineer and as I work through more academic work relating to stats and data science, I find that I am actually not that fond of it. Another thing that I have learned from my company in the first year is that they are not quite willing to fully commit me to either data engineering or to data science roles, instead intending to keep me in this weird consultancy-hybrid position.</p>

<p>Because of this and the low initial salary, i find it pretty clear that this position is a dead-end long term but is a very valuable opportunity for me to learn a lot of skills for my future as a data engineer.</p>

U might see on aliexpress white tank CISS or like pre-made solutions for all inks that come separately. Tbh it makes some sense because the white ink is a pigment ink. 

The plan I came up with is was to buy a mini peristaltic pump which sits between the ink tank and the ink tubes to the dampers. Then use a splitter where the ink splits to dampers and then another tube goes back into the ink tank. Essentially your making a closed loop. This would basically circulate the ink constantly and prevent the issue where due to the ink being denser the printer head isn‚Äôt able to pull it up.

4559,inzz33,"So I bought the 88d pro and AA99 in September of 2021 and have been using 88d pro for doubles and 99 for singles which soon became 88d pro for everything because 99 hurt my arms. Over the year playing with it has made me progressively feel like I'm getting less power in, and my shots are weaker and more flat. Recently I decided to use the 99 after it has been sitting in my bag for a while, and that smash power the net play feels nice and strong again. And it just feels refreshing, I guess.

A way to describe the 99 feelings would be:

\- smashes feel and sound amazing

\- those checky taps and mid-court drops are clean and satisfying

\- back clears are nice and high, with drops feeling controlled.

Here is a way to describe my current feeling about the 88d pro:

* smashes feel weak and slow
* those taps and net shots don't go over to go to high, and the opponent just smashes it into us
* back clears are weaker, and much more mid clears
* The sound of the shuttle is super dull
* maybe because of biased feelings but I feel like I don't have much control also

I looked into getting the 100zz or the nanoflare 800 as although the 99 was refreshing,g I still had somewhat of a sore arm after and recently, my style has progressed from a lot of smashes to a considerable amount of drops and 100zz/nanoflare 800 seemed to fit my style well. However, I'm not sure if I should go out and buy a new racket. Most reviews and videos say the 88d pro is one of the best, making me feel like I'm doing something wrong instead. Therefore, I am looking for things I could do to see if I can use my 88d pro again.

One theory I have is my string is the bg Ultimax @ 26lbs, and I haven't changed them yet and was looking to instead shift into the aerobic or bg80 @ 28 lbs or something and see how that goes

I appreciate any advice for my very unique situation.","<div class=""md""><p>So I bought the 88d pro and AA99 in September of 2021 and have been using 88d pro for doubles and 99 for singles which soon became 88d pro for everything because 99 hurt my arms.

if you graduate with zero internships then it will be very difficult to find your first job, regardless of how good your gpa is.

4842,omarelwaliely1,"Id just choose a niche that you really like since initially youll feel really good about it but a few months in your probably wont have made much money and you may feel like you wsnt to quit but if its in a niche you really enjoy its just that much more incentive to continue, also you know which posts and such are good if yourr into the niche. Also dont worry about the mother thing, generally i dont think a lot of people ask for help from their parents or anyone else for that matter when it comes to themepages just check online youtube will have a ton of tips (I watched Biaheza) and look arounf this subreddit to see what else people think. Ill give you the overview of what i sent someone a few days ago: idk if its your first time doing a theme page or not, but anyway just incase ill treat it as such. So first of all, make a clean bio say what you are and put some keywords in it so when people look you up they find you for example if ‚Äúgirl‚Äù isnt already in your name make sure its in your bio in some way. Make a simple logo. Make sure its as simple and as efficient as possible, look at any good company or page youll see a simple logo, sometimes just a letter or a design. Make sure you made about 9 posts before you actually start following people if you already did and didnt make 9 posts dont stress, your page just looks more active so the follow back rate will be slightly higher. The most important thing is analyzing competitors, look at big pages small pages and dont be afraid to follow them, if you want to unfollow later go for it but its nice to follow and keep post notifications on, why? Well lets say there‚Äôs a small page with 2k followers and within 20 minutes they get 50 likes chances are these people who liked are active and enjoy her posts follow them for a good follow back rate. Use relevant hashtags. I dont remember the exact scheme, but you can see my previous posts if you want an exact number, you basically want hashtags in the range of 5k -500k with most of those being in the lower range (only 1 or 2 hashtags near the 500k) It wouldnt be to bad to watch youtubers do it and read articles but make sure theyre not just ‚Äúgurus‚Äù trying to milk you out for some money, a good one I watched was Biaheza.

The most important thing is consistency. If you want to succeed in this just dont give up. If someone else did it that means your goal is possible so dont change it change your plan. Any other tip i can give you other than that isnt at the top of my head and you‚Äôll end out learning it by yourself, so goodluck and stay consistent!

If you want 1k followers its a very achievable goal, took me 1 month but dont expect to make money (unless youre some product page) until youre at 10k followers

As you put links in your bio you already take steps above those people next step here Id say is to direct peoples attention to your bio</p>

I‚Äôm not sure if you already do that or not, but for some reason instagram favors accounts that post more videos to be in explore and allows accounts that post photos to rank better in explore, so I try to upload a video a day at least. Since your account is sort of large it may be in your best favor to also look at bigger hashtags if you havent. People definitely don‚Äôt give hashtags as much credit as they deserve.

Dont be afraid to experiment, a lot of people think it makes their account look bad since if the hashtag group they tested was bad 3 or 4 posts will have super low reach.

And their SMTP when notice that server is going to block you or blocked you it warns you 
and It auto change the IP Address and modify the System fingerprints to look like a new device
they are in origin a virgin residential proxy provider
So it is very easy for them to change the IP address and modify the remote VPS using Antidetect and they already say that on AP news
as they say even if was little change Whatever they give you all instructions</p>

 you need to install a rotation residential proxy on the server too and make it change the ip every 10 minutes.

But if you plan to send something like 100k emails a day you wpuld need that

No man

There is always a new ways to bypass mail servers sercurity measures
They crwate something and we also create something
that will never end

One of my new ways to send 100% bulk mail to inbox is buy an RDP
Install bulk mail sender on it

Buy cheap residential rotation proxy package from a proxy provider that allows bulk mail like Liber8Proxy.com

And then i setup the rotation IP residential proxy on the RDP and run the SMTP mail sender

just make sure make some edits every 10k emails in the letter.

Liber8Proxy also created a new package contains all that in one package for 3 months that so-called ""Professional Package"" 
contains 3 months of unlimited residential proxy and you can choose rotation time + RDP + VPS + Anti detect tool to create a profile fingerprints for each Proxy

All of that for very cheap price compared to the other sites. any proxy provider else would sell it for 5k a month.

I am still on another package so I did not test that professional package yet, but would buy it once my current package expires.

""The biochemical estimation of cow urine has shown that it contains sodium, nitrogen, sulphur, Vitamin A, B, C, D, E, minerals, manganese, iron, silicon, chlorine, magnesium, citric, succinic, calcium salts, phosphate, lactose, carbolic acid, enzymes, creatinine and hormones [3].

5136,synthphreak,"There is no ""universal behavior"" for `|`. It is up to individual objects to define for themselves. So just because it does this or that with strings or booleans isn't necessarily relevant for pandas objects.

Case in point:

    >>> class X:
    ...     def __or__(self, other):
    ...         print('foo')
    ...
    >>> X() | True
    foo

    >>> s2 = {3, 4, 5}
    >>> s1 | s2
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

In the case of pandas objects, `|` returns a boolean series indicating whether EITHER of the values at a given index is truthy.

In your example, `0.5` is always truthy, hence why the boolean series is all `True`. See what happens if you change the first or last `0.5` to `False`, meaning that index will contain only falsey values...

5150,synthphreak,"Lol, it‚Äôs not too hard.

Say you want to compare two algorithms to see which is more efficient. To do so, you‚Äôd tell them each to process an array of 10^1 items, then record the runtimes. Then you‚Äôd do the same with 10^2 items. Then again with 10^(3), then 10^(4), then 10^(5), etc. out to infinity. This is what I meant by ‚Äúlimiting behavior‚Äù - how they behave when you take things to the extreme.

If you plot the curves with n items on x and runtimes on y, you will see how each algorithms scales as a function of the input size. This is essentially what Big O is all about (though it‚Äôs not necessarily about runtimes, as efficiency can be defined in numerous ways). With some simplification, you‚Äôll find that most curves fall into a small number of categories, like linear, logarithmic, or exponential. Each category has a special name in Big O notation (e.g., ‚ÄúBig O(n)‚Äù for linear behavior), but the concept is the same.

Ultimately, the curve with the lower slope will scale better, meaning it is more efficient. Big O allows you to determine this somewhat rigorously.

Obviously the specific runtime of an algorithm IRL will be determined not just input size but also by extraneous factors like hardware specs, phase of the moon, etc., that cannot be reproduced and are just noise for the purposes of this abstract comparison. So Big O is a kind of technique which, using simple algebraic functions, allows you to strip away that noise and focus purely on the signal of how algorithms scale.

So Big O is a kind of technique which, using simple algebraic functions, allows you to strip away that noise and focus purely on the signal of how algorithms scale.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

In a relatively short period too, like maybe 1-2 weeks, I suddenly became terrible at responding to texts. Also emails. Suddenly I just started feeling overwhelmed by it all, the need to constantly be available across numerous media while also balancing my own needs throughout the day e.g., work, parenting, cooking, reading.

It would be easier if everything was one-off, like receive, reply, the end. But so often a text from a friend or family member is the first of several in what can turn into a lengthy conversation with many rounds of back and forth. One moment I used to be able to balance multiple such interactions throughout the day with the rest of my life, but the next moment, I felt like I couldn't anymore. So now when I get a text, I put it off until ""later"" when I can focus on it, then inevitably forget.

Anyway, that was about 2 years ago and I have not recovered. I don't understand it, but I hate it so much.

5208,synthphreak,"I did! It's a bit complex to explain, and I confess I don't fully understand the mechanics. But I got things working, and that's good enough for me at the moment.

The complication ended up stemming from the [`zsh-vi-mode` plugin](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode) which, when sourced, overwrites many keybindings defined on earlier lines in .zshrc. So [its README directs you to create a `zvm_after_init` function](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode#execute-extra-commands), inside of which you should source source all the stuff that creates keybindings you want to persist.

What I didn't know - and the part I don't fully understand how it works - is that `zvm_after_init` seems to get executed not as soon as `zsh-vi-mode` is done being sourced, but after your entire .zshrc is done being sourced! This means that at login, additional code was being run after my .zshrc, and incidentally that additional code is where all my keybindings get set (e.g., sourcing `fzf`). This is why my attempts to place debugging lines periodically throughout my .zshrc weren't giving me the full story.

Given that the `zsh-vi-mode` plugin is sourced *inside* my .zshrc, and that the `zvm_after_init` function is defined *inside* my .zshrc, I don't get how the former could execute the latter *outside* of my .zshrc. Perhaps you have some idea, as somehow who clearly understands zsh plumbing well?

Anyway, once I realized that this was happening, the solution was easy: I created a whole new file, `keybindings.zsh`, in which I overwrite keybindings sourced from elsewhere with the keybindings shown in the post. Then I sourced that file as the last line of the `zvm_after_init` function. This way, no matter how, when, or from where that function is run, it will always follow everything else, and be the last thing that touches my keybindings.

Hope that makes sense! This was tricky!","<div class=""md""><p>I did! It&#39;s a bit complex to explain, and I confess I don&#39;t fully understand the mechanics. But I got things working, and that&#39;s good enough for me at the moment.</p>

<p>And if &quot;you should list them but not necessarily every single thing&quot;, how to prioritize what to include and what to exclude?</p>

You are deducing too much from my language which I don't think it is right.

As I said in my other replies, it is natural for people to accept the popular narrative ""Boss always bad, Employees always right"".  But there is another side of the story. This side of the story often does not get heard because people assume the boss is privileged.

""put on your own humble-pants, and do some self-reflection.""

To give you more background. I run a bootstrapped startup. I and other co-founders take 50% less market salary just so that we can pay our employees more. In the initial years we took zero salary. Right now we are at a growing phase and we have hired FTE to take some burden off our plate. There are days where I still code, do sales pitch, do marketing, do people management, take care of company finances/taxes etc. 

This is the struggle most people don't hear about. 

This particular FTE was clearly explained what his roles and responsibilities were. We also clearly told all our FTEs how their salary is getting paid (courtesy the client projects we have).  So they know what is on the line.  

Now put yourself in my shoes and think this - the FTE has lack of skills, does not complete his work on time and does not even care how or who will complete it.  Respect is a two way street. I can't respect a employee who refuses to work, is unapologetic and has no respect for co-workers.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

This is almost certainly the answer. I'm not at all familiar with programming for the NES, but a quick Google suggests that most games were written in 6502 Assembly. A second quick Google suggested that there isn't a built-in way to generate random numbers. That means that a developer wanting to add random numbers of fireworks would either have to write some code to come up with a random number at the cost of a few valuable bits, or use something that the machine is already keeping track of.

Of course, if there is already a way in the code to generate random numbers then all bets are off. If someone with a better grasp of 6502 Assembly than I have wants to look for it, I found some disassembled code [here](https://gist.github.com/1wErt3r/4048722).","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

5525,productanalyst9,"I had to make a similar decision a few months ago between the online Notre Dame Masters in Data Science (a bit different from the Business Analytics program you are looking at I think) and the online Masters in Data Science from Northwestern. I ended up going with Northwestern.

&#x200B;

It's definitely a tough choice, as others have pointed out, both are good schools. The main aspects things I considered were:

&#x200B;

1. Flexibility. Work keeps me pretty busy and I wanted the flexibility to take only one class per quarter. Northwestern wins on this front. The program I looked at at Notre Dame offered no flexibility, I think students had to take 2 classes at a time. This turned out to be a good decision for me because I almost died my first quarter taking 2 classes at a time. I'm taking just one class now and it is much more manageable, although it will take me longer to complete the program.
2. Networking / cohort. Notre Dame is better for this I think. You come in as a cohort and take all the same classes together at the same time. You also attend all the same lectures, whereas a lot of classes in the Northwestern program are asynchronous (no lectures or the lectures are live). Notre Dame's method makes it easier for you to connect with your fellow classmates since you spend almost 2 years taking the same exact classes with the same \~40 people. It's not impossible at Northwestern but you'll have to work harder at networking.
3. Job placement. Both programs have graduates at all sorts of companies. Ultimately I think Northwestern gets the edge because their data science program has been around longer so there are more graduates. Also they've had time to work out most of the kinks in the program.

They are both great schools so I think the quality of the education will mostly depend on how much time and effort you put in to learning the material. Check out the Analytics Management specialization in the Northwestern program, it might be what you are looking for since you are trying to move into management.","<div class=""md""><p>I had to make a similar decision a few months ago between the online Notre Dame Masters in Data Science (a bit different from the Business Analytics program you are looking at I think) and the online Masters in Data Science from Northwestern.

Stick it out anyway, unless you're really thinking data science isn't your career path. Here's my logic.

If you stick it out, you have resume fodder and can speak to experience working in the tech sector, two things you didn't have before. Data Science does not have a well-defined career path and data scientists have a very fluid job description from company to company, industry to industry and even within companies on different teams. No tech sector experience is truly worthless.

If you don't stick it out, you need a damned good reason. Your school will not look kindly on it. During my undergrad a fellow classmate landed what was honestly a dream internship doing regression analyses. It taught her she shouldn't have been in the field because she had no interest, and eventually just dropped out. The company was so mad they severed ties with the school, and my classmate ended up dropping out. I think it was her, not the school, but she did a lot of damage. 

You also owe it to your future self to stick it out. Shitty pay? I had three internships, only two were paid and it wasn't much. Long commute? Listen to some good podcasts, or try to arrange a 4/10 instead of 5/8. Tell them you're taking that fifth day to work on an AWS certificate (which will do you good).

And it's the ""largely"" part that we defend - the legal gun owners who respect laws and don't abuse the trust we place with a firearm, the police who respect civil rights of suspected offenders, the protestors who assemble to speak and create community and not to cause violence.  


But I have to take issue with the violence of the gun owners who abuse that trust, and the police officers who abuse that trust, and the protestors who abuse that trust.   


St. Louis burned during those BLM protests. The mayor's house, libraries, shops and small businesses owned by African-Americans, all damaged. Most of the people weren't violent, but some were.

Two, kinda the opposite, you were way more effective than your boss thought and now she doesn't know what to do with you.

The solution for both is to use the time to work on things that are valuable to you and the company. Ideas, sure. Development, definitely. I'd even suggest adding a certificate in something you currently lack but could build up expertise in. This is an opportunity to grow.

Buddhists believe the sense of self, or ""I,"" is an illusion because we (the self) constantly change. Our thoughts, feelings, and sensations are always coming and going. When I experience fear, it's not who I am. It is only a thought that comes and goes.

*For example*,  
Consider yourself an observer on the edge of a stream. Your emotions, sensations, and ideas are like a leaf on that stream. They should not engulf or enchant you. Try not to obsess over the leaf long after it disappears. Granted, a leaf may not enchant or engross you, but anger or fear may. These are more powerful emotions.

The leaf, like your emotions, should be viewed with curiosity. Examine it. Then let the leaf go. The same can be said of anger or fear. It is best to watch them rise and fall. Treat them with skepticism and question them. Maybe you can come to the point where your emotions hold no more power over you than a leaf. Don't let them destroy you.

When we become too attached to the idea of a permanent self, we may chase something out of reach or even false. ""I am the best, or I am nothing."" When we see the self as an illusion, we can relinquish our attachments to it.

Secondly, The last line of your error output is the message to focus on.

This means that your changes caused some '`NaN`' 'Not a number'

My suggestion is simple and ironic. If you changed something and it did not work then change it back. The change you made caused '`NaN`' to be introduced, a very common error.

What you are doing is fine because you are learning what the code does and how to manipulate it. Keep going.

`from pydub import AudioSegment`  
`from pydub.effects import compress`

May I make a suggestion? In the first paragraph below the company name/title you have 4 long sentences that do not seem to follow the rule of give them numbers or give then your wins.

For example, in one sentence 'skilled in navigating fast paced environments, managing multiple projects and making budgetary decisions.' 

Q. Many offices are fast paced but could you tell the reader how many priority projects? Were they top priority to the CEO or board? Could you tell the reader what percent of the company you managed (numbers or value) or what percent of important accounts.  How much did you work drive your company budget?

Does not the 'give-them-numbers-rule' hold for a VP level as it does for sales or programmers?

Men calling women ""bitches"", ""whores"" ""hoe"" ""slut"" ""gold digger"" or anything of that nature. the b word IS a sexist slur and so is any variation of it. I always notice men get so much pleasure from calling women bitches and i don't know why. another thing is listening to misogynistic music and watching porn those two things objectify and degrade women. Not to mention the trafficking and rape that goes on in the porn industry.
2. Women applying toxic standards to other women. criticizing other women for the way they dress, mothers teaching their daughters how to cook and clean but not their sons. ""Don't wear that"" ""You'll tempt the boys""

4. mansplaining is explaining something to a woman in a condescending tone and assuming a woman doesnt know something solely because she's a woman.

I've also seen that often times, those women may not have the same accolades that a man does, or may be, from a purely experience- and skills-based perspective, unqualified (feel free to negate this point with statistics that invalidate whatever I stated above). My point is that all these corporations, to seem diverse, would rather guarantee equality of outcome over equality of opportunity. If they really cared about women in the workforce, shouldn't they be going to highly misogynistic societies and promoting women in fields like STEM, through workshops, and stuff, geared towards empowering women?  
The reason I ask this is because I've often heard the phrase ""representation matters"", and I wanna understand what exactly it means.
5. Women in highly misogynistic societies arent even allowed to leave their own homes and put themselves in danger if they even try. Representation definitely matters thats why as feminists we need to protect these women and ensure that women are educated so they know their rights. And yes ur right companies dont really care about women they care about making money. the sole reason women got the right to work is so that there is double the amount of people paying taxes. its a very sad reality we must continue to dismantle the patriarchy.
