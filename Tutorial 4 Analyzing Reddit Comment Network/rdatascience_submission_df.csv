Im currently in the process of mastering out of my Neuroscience PhD program with the hopes of finding a job in data science/engineering or software engineering. During my time in the program, I’ve learned how to code in MATLAB, R and SAS, and have used these skills to statistically analyze and visualize neural time series data. While working on this project, I discovered that I loved working on the data analysis component more than anything else, and figured it would be best to take the risk and pivot directions in my career.

I recently completed an internship in a somewhat rural/suburban city in the Midwest and they reached out with a return offer. I'm also graduating from a relatively (T20) prestigious university with a degree in statistics and data science. The return offer is only available in the midwest city that the internship was located in and the pay is really good for a new grad in my field. I will also mention that I am not in a stressful financial situation; if I don't take the job, I will survive.

My question is: Is it worth it to turn down this offer for the opportunity of something better?

I have two options at hand. 

**Option 1: Take the return offer**

**Pros**

* Good six-figure pay with a $20k sign-on and available target bonuses
* The location has a low cost of living
* Hybrid, very lenient work-life balance

**Cons**

* I'm stuck with the company for two years
* There isn't much to do in the town
* No friends or family within 800 miles of the location
* Can't pursue a master's program aside from the local university

**Option 2: Pursue a Master's degree/higher paying role**

**Pros**

* More flexibility in career and education
* Can stay in the city where my friends and family live
* Can find a potentially better role or even a prestigious Master's program in statistics OR cs

**Cons**

* Nothing is guaranteed; had a really hard time getting this internship in the first place
* Potentially lower pay or even no money if companies don't take me
* Have to focus on applications for both jobs and universities in the fall

&#x200B;

I have data that e.g. a flyer was given to 1000 people, and 10 people scanned a code - on a particular day at a particular location. The number of flyers handed out on a day varies.

&#x200B;

My aim is to create a predictive model: if we hand out flyers on X day at Y locaiton in X industry, how many will convert/what will be the conversion rate? (Convert in this case is buying a product, scanning a 2D barcode, visiting a URL, etc)

&#x200B;

I can think of 2 ways to model this

&#x200B;

1. make a regression model where one of the independent variables is the total number of flyers handed out, and the dependent variable is the total number of conversions. This number is typically between 0 and 100.

2. make a regression model to predict the conversion \*rate\*, that is, a number between 0 and 1.

&#x200B;

My conversion rate and conversions are both very skewed when I plot them on a histogram. E.g. 30% of the time, a marketing campaign has 0 conversions. Then 1 is the next commonest count, then 2, etc...

&#x200B;

For this reason I am sure vanilla logistic regression and many other models will not work very well.

&#x200B;

I am considering one idea being a 2-level model: a binary classifier to classify into zero and non-zero, then a separate classifier trained on a log scale.

&#x200B;

I am wondering also if the conversions can be modelled as a Poisson process because the curve looks like that. But is there a kind of predictive model that can do that?

This is my first time posting here, so I apologise if I am out of place. 

My team is currently utilising SageMaker pipelines to coordinate model training. In the past, we encountered issues where the pipeline was misconfigured during cloud execution, resulting in challenging-to-debug errors 🐛

I've been delving into the idea of using Localstack and SageMaker LocalPipelineSession to execute the pipeline locally prior to deployment on the cloud ☁️. I've successfully implemented this on my local machine, using pytest and pytest-bdd to craft integration tests 🧪

Building on that success, I've ventured into creating a GitLab CI job that runs these tests upon making a merge request. A peculiar aspect of SageMaker pipelines in a local setup is its reliance on Docker. To address this, I've designed a custom Docker image, enabling installation of Python, my dependencies, Docker, and Docker Compose. The job initialises LocalStack and executes the tests. Nevertheless, running these tests within GitLab has brought about Docker-in-Docker related challenges 🐳 It's been quite a frustrating experience... The SageMaker pipelines run, although unsuccessfully with silent errors 🤫

I wanted to bring your attention to the upcoming elections in Zimbabwe scheduled for this Wednesday. The past election raised significant concerns due to allegations of unfairness, including claims of collusion between the electoral commission and the ruling party to manipulate results using Excel files, an issue that has been dubbed ""Excelgate.""

Taking a closer look at the available data on the official website, I've stumbled upon some noteworthy findings. These findings have prompted me to write an article on LinkedIn, where I explore how they tie into the broader 'Excelgate' narrative. Additionally, I delve into the steps citizens have been taking to ensure the integrity of their votes during the upcoming election.

I've been working as a Data Analyst for a year now, using SQL, Excel, and Tableau, and have another year in Business Intelligence. I'd like to dive more into Data Science.  


I was looking at some alternatives that fit my budget and GA Techs OMSA comes up and this particular Master in Data Science from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, which is highly ranked, #1 in Latin America, and #104 globally. Link: [https://www.coursera.org/degrees/magister-en-ciencia-de-datos-ucchile](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/magister-en-ciencia-de-datos-ucchile)  


Since it's in Spanish (I'm a Spanish speaker) I will provide some details:  


**Cost**: $10k, up to 25% discount in early application and enrollment. So the cost can decrease to $7500  
**Platform**: Coursera  
**Duration:** 24 months, 22 hours weekly  
**Requirements**: 2 years of work experience in a related area, motivation letter, and vague details on GPA for Bachelors which should be in Data Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, Basic Sciences, or *other related areas*.  Proficiency in intermediate-level programming. Equivalent to at least an Introduction to Programming MOOC (in Python, R, SQL). Spanish proficiency.  


**Required Courses:**  
Introduction to Programming in Python 

Databases 

Data Analysis in Python 

Introduction to Data Science 

Data Visualization 

Statistical and Computational Learning 

Software Engineering 

Massive Data Processing 

Responsible Data Science 

Time Series

&#x200B;

**Elective Courses**:

Deep Learning 

Recommender Systems 

Image processing 

Applied Statistics 

Bayesian methods 

Social Network Analysis 

&#x200B;

From the FAQ I found these interesting questions: 

  
1.  **Is the program accredited?‎** 

No, since it is not a requirement in Chile. However, the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile presents the highest accreditation given by the National Accreditation Commission of Chile. 

 2. **Will there be a graduation ceremony?‎** 

Yes, a graduation ceremony will be held remotely and you will receive your physical diploma.   


3. **Can I switch between the online program and in-person?**

 No, since this program does not exist in an  in-person format.   


**4. Are there internships or internships that are part of the program?**

This program, for the moment, does not include student exchanges or internships.

&#x200B;

I would like what your thoughts are. It seems to be good for a very affordable price. I think it's fairly new, started in 2021 or so. I haven't been able to find any reviews from students taking it. I plan to move to the US in \~5 years when I get my residency permit. I guess a Master's from a US University would have more weight? What do you guys think about the coursework? They also like GATech provide a $2000 Micro Master MOOC that you can later transfer. Anyway, let me know what you guys think about this option. Thanks!

TL:DR. I'm building an analytical platform to offer prediction and information to decision maker to run their business better and increase profit. A friend is impress by what I have setup and want to join me. He say that retail industries reporting and sales visualization is terrible and we could offer better visualization and reporting. Initially agree that we could work together. He kept wanting to retrofit retail industries software reporting into my platform and say it should be the initial goal. I strongly disagree since I say it's not the goal of my platform and I don't believe there's much money to be made by offering yet another Power BI. While I will be offering visualization for forecasting, trend, prediction, my goal is WHAT WILL HAPPEN based on WHAT HAPPENED. It's not to show a up to the pennies/quantity how much money they made yesterday and having them use this to generate report for invoice, billing and else. I want my future user to use my platform to understand trend, customer behavior, seasonality. By selling my platform as an investment and a tool (that replace bias humans) I'm able to charge a lot more than basic visualization which will enable me to invest heavily into R&D to further improve the quality of my prediction (I'm expecting a pay roles of 1M$ for statistician, behavioral psychologist, marketing/ads expert, math graduate and else)  . He say we could do both and that what customer want right now (yet another nice looking dashboard). But I strongly disagree that combining both is the things to do for the following reason:  


\-If I show them the visualization and the prediction/forecasting (what they want vs what they need), they won't understand the pricing and ask me well I don't need forecasting we do it ourselves,  just give us the visualization. I feel this will most likely cannibalize my product.  
\-By offering a visualization you are again seen as a administrative expense. I will have a hard time justifying the pricing of my platform against a Power BI/Tableau for peoples that don't understand yet the importance of prediction and forecasting.  


I feel like we are just seeing things differently and have fundamental difference. He work with client and want to offer what they ask so he can do money right away and reduce risk. I'm an entrepreneur, I'm building something they don't presently request (because they have no idea it remotely possible) and I'm willing to face difficulty and challenge.  


&#x200B;

Context if peoples are interested:  


I've been working in IT for the past 15 years in different roles (support, integration, cybersecurity, business analyst, it analyst, sql,...) mainly revolving around the retail industries. After noticing the lack of real analytics and seeing decision maker using always the same old inaccurate prediction, I had the idea 7 years ago to offer real analytics to the retail market. The idea has been brewing in my head ever since. All the features that I wanted were documented and research by me and I have a clear vision of what I see as the future.  


Now: unable to find a developer to partner with me and with the arrival of ChatGPT, I started a few months ago to build the necessary skills to reach my goal. I learned Python, pandas, started to build models on existing data, identify/develop/implement my future software architecture. I now have a fully functional lab with Apache Sparks/Hive on Yarn/Hdfs cluster, gpu cluster for Nvidia Rapids processing, Kafka for real-time streaming from customer site, and blablabla, Apache Superset/Dash Plotly web service for visualization.

I'm in the early stages of planning a project using bayesian statistical models that might benefit from a GPU. I'm looking for any advice / pointers on what hardware I should consider. 

The project is more beefy than what I would run on a PC, but significantly less than some of the ML/AI projects that get pushed to the cloud. Based on conversations with peers, these models can take a few days to run, so I'm looking to build a dedicated server for the job. The specific library I'm considering (STAN) already has [built in support for GPU processing](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/opencl.html). So the issue comes down to hardware. As I understand it (I barely do), that library supports GPUs with OpenCL (e.g. NVIDIA).

* Should I be looking at GPUs specific to computation? Or, am I looking at gaming GPUs?
* I understand that GPU memory is more relevant that the number of cores. Are there other variables I should focus on?
* Based on what's currently available in the market, is it worth it to spend money on a better GPU? Or go with the cheapest? I understand that GPUs sometimes scale inefficiently. I wonder if most of the benefit comes from the initial hurdle of pushing to a GPU, with much fewer benefit of scale thereafter. 

Specific recommendations are great, but I'm more interested in how to think through this from the perspective of a data scientist.

A few years ago, I was part of an unofficial research group. No contracts or any type of payment was involved. The lead of the group was a university professor. 

During that period, a colleague and I worked on a project with a case study of a prediction model. My colleague did the machine learning model and I designed the architecture and developed a platform that consumed the model and provided results and visualisations. 

We submitted it to a competition as a group but we didn’t get the first place. 

Fast forward. I am in industry now and don’t have plans to return to academia. Found out that a few months ago, that work got published in a journal with Author 1: my colleague, Author 2: the professor and Author 3 someone external that never worked on it. 

I was never asked about it. Author 1 said that he tried to include me but Author 2 was against it since I am not part of the group anymore. There are other dependencies between the two and he didn’t want to push it more. 

It’s not an innovation or an impressive work. I never thought of publishing it. However I feel cheated.
