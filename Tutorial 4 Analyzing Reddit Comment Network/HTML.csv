The way I describe frontend to people is... HTML is the bones, CSS is the skin and JavaScript is the muscles and nerves that move the system... Organs are the api resources or data or anything that makes the website Contentful

So with HTML you have just started or the first step to software development

Nah, your post isn't stupid at all, it's actually quite intelligent, thinking about the possibilities that exist in what you've learned. 

Someone else answered your question already and much better than I could. But welcome to the coding community! Don't worry about getting a site up on the web just yet, you'll get there soon enough. Next step is [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI), and that's where you'll see a lot more possibilities.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

2,pookage,"Just HTML? You can say what *is*.  HTML is part of the trinity of the web - as /u/darkshadow609 has pointed out, already: HTML *is* the web, CSS changes how it looks, and Javascript lets you change the HTML and CSS in whatever way you want - taken together you can make....well...pretty much anything really!  That's part of why web development is so great - it's versatile, relatively simple to learn, and is made-up of lots of little building blocks, so the journey is made up of easily-digestable iterative chunks!

If you're looking for a place to start, then, as with most things - MDN is a great resource and has [a whole bunch of tutorials that will take you through the opening steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn); once you know what you're looking for it should also be your go-to reference resource!

If you get stuck, then come here for all your HTML questions, /r/css for anything to do with styling, and /r/learnjavascript for your JS-releated questions!

I would avoid the trap of thinking that you start with HTML, progress to CSS, and then finish with JS - they are definitely a trinity, and you should absolutely try to learn them simultaneously and give each equal weight; you will encounter a lot of folks who don't, and who subsequently write atrocious HTML, or try to solve every problem with JS, or look for CSS-only solutions to things that are better done holistically.

But aye, good luck, and I look forward to seeing more posts from you in the future!","<div class=""md""><p>Just HTML? You can say what <em>is</em>.

HTML is a *[computer language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language)*, and a *[markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)*, to be sure, but it is not a programming language. HTML literally stands for *H*yper*T*ext ***M*arkup *L*anguage**.

Changing it to just center works for me, but i'm not sure about HD resolution sizes. And obviously the orientation is different to your example; the yellow of the image is more in the center of the page instead of behind the search input.

Box-shadow on your line doesn't work on any browser for me, either. Not sure why.

Unless you're building it for a school assessment that requires XHTML you can ditch that for the HTML5 doctype as well.

You're code isn't XHTML valid anyway, so no point to it.

Always use this one, it's backwards compatible, and the other ones are old/not worth using anymore. 

And remember to include the type as well. I.e.:

        <meta charset=""utf-8"">

If you don't use the Doctype, certain browsers will break compatibility because they expect there to be one (most versions of IE). If that wasn't the case we wouldn't even need the doctype declaration at all in HTML5.

* I think you should put the files into a GitHub repository instead of sharing them through Goggle Drive. There are several reasons for this, code maintainability etc.
* Your video is a *tutorial* so you don't need to write comments live, you can just explain what each part does as you're writing. You could put the comments there before you upload the files, incase somebody doesn't want to go back to the video.
* You used VSCode's side by side editing but after about six minutes, you focused entirely on the CSS for the rest of the video. Next time, you should minimize the HTML file.
* I'm not saying the viewer won't be able to see the code well, *but* the font is *pretty small* for a **tutorial**. If you're making a tutorial and explaining every part of the code, you should increase the font size. I don't see a point in having already explained code taking up 3/4 of the screen.
* The microphone quality is very bad, sometimes I can barely hear you over the noise. I'd recommend applying noise reduction to your audio or recording your voice using your phone instead. There is also a lot of pausing in the video, you should rehearse beforehand (see my lower point).
* Most of the mistakes above can be fixed by writing a script and rehearsing it first; you were pausing a lot in the video. This will cut down the video length significantly and will also make the video easier to understand.  
A lot of the popular coding tutorial channels write the code first, then write the script, then record themselves writing the code and talking at the same time, reviewing to see if anything can be improved, then possibly doing the last take and uploading it.  
I'm not saying you have to do all of the above, but putting some more thought into the video and maybe having a note with all the main points you want to make would be good.

I want to be clear you are asking for advice and seem like you want to learn, I am not trying to destroy what you have done or otherwise try to break your confidence, you are 13 and this is very good. I help college students that could not make something this clean. I have been doing this for longer than you have been alive, so here is some honest feedback.

* I have an ultrawide monitor and the cards can't handle it.  [https://imgur.com/a/1lnxG7X](https://imgur.com/a/1lnxG7X)  This might be an edge case, but you should keep it in mind.
* I am not a fan of the inconsistencies. The outer 2 cards have the word Ingredientes to indicate it is a list of ingredients, but that is missing from the middle card.
* I would add a little more padding where the text is. As it is now the text runs right up to the edge. A small amount of padding will help a ton. In the .container .card p{} add padding: 10px; Then scale the page up and down and notice the difference. 
* When scaling the browser down the cards become too skinny, maybe rethink the breakpoint for when the cards go vertical. Use the Chrome developer tools (F12) You can toggle the device toolbar and see how the site looks on different devices. The Ipad looks the worst in my opinion, the cards are too skinny. You may not need all the ingredients on the card, just list the first few then put an ellipse (...) to indicate there are more. 
* Personally, I am not a fan of pure white text on pure black, on the buttons it is too harsh, I would lighten up the black like you did at the top (#333), much easier on the eyes.
* I do like the hover effect on the index page, it is smooth and clear what card I am on. I do NOT like the hover effect on the secondary page. There are not multiple cards, so what is the effect telling me? I find it distracting on the secondary page.

With all that said, I would be very happy if a jr developer brought this to me for a code review. It is overall clean and crisp and the issues are fairly minor. Keep plugging away, you have a bright future. Really, I have gotten worse from more seasoned developers.

Hey, great job!!! You got an upvote from me! You have done an amazing job. Celebrate your accomplishment! It's also impressive that you also got a site launched on surge as well! :)

A little advice: try not to downplay your accomplishments. Learn about [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). It's something a lot of developers/programmers/coders/techies (myself included) can suffer from, but understanding it is a huge step to combat feeling like what you are learning and producing isn't ""good enough."" Trust me, the majority of people could not even make a site like yours. :)

It&#39;s something a lot of developers/programmers/coders/techies (myself included) can suffer from, but understanding it is a huge step to combat feeling like what you are learning and producing isn&#39;t &quot;good enough.&quot; Trust me, the majority of people could not even make a site like yours. :)</p>

<p>Keep it up! Never stop learning! You&#39;re gonna do great!!</p>

215,WikiTextBot,"**Impostor syndrome**

Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which people doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent, often internalized fear of being exposed as a ""fraud"". The term was coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes. Despite external evidence of their competence, those exhibiting the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.

When XHTML is no longer developed as a separate spec, the spec is dead. If we [look at the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/), it says:

That was in December of 2010, over 6 years ago! The people in the XHTML WG were transitioned to HTML WG if they chose to be.

437,Citrous_Oyster,"A lot! I’m a freelancer and I only know and use html and css. I build static brochure sites for small businesses. Little 5 pagers. The trick is to actually make a good site! There’s so much more that goes into making a good site that often gets overlooked and you can use these pain points as selling points and sell solutions to them. Like load times and page speed. When you code a website in only html and css you have no render blocking third party scripts and plugins slowing you down. No google CDN font links, no bloat. You control what is going into your site and how everything loads. Google ranks websites based on their mobile performance for its core vitals metrics. If you fails these core vitals, you lose out on some ranking. But if you custom code you can optimize your site to score 100/100. All my sites end up scoring 98-100/100. So that’s a pain point solved. And if your website takes more than 3 seconds to load you lose like 30% of your traffic because they leave before the site could load. By loading instantly you can capture 30% more of your incoming traffic by ensuring they doing leave before the site loads. Pain point solved. If you want to learn how to get 100/100 page speed scores I also wrote a page speed handbook that details every little thing I do to get 100/100

https://codestitch.app/page-speed-handbook

You can do all that with html and css alone. 

Then there’s the content. Everything I do is called on page SEO. That’s the content, design, and load times. Things I can control as a developer. What I do is I do searches for my clients keywords in large city metro areas in a different state and open all the top ranking sites. I analyze the keywords they’re using and content, feed it into chatGPT and have it write new content based on that content from those pages and to pretend it’s a copywriter for websites. Then it gives me the content, I edit it to make it sound more human or change sentence structure, and add it to the site. I know what sections I need on a site and what order and what content I need and where to put the keywords. I do this for interior service pages called content silos as well. These content silos are pages dedicated to 1 service. That entire page is all about that 1 service. Like this page I did

https://striveptwellness.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/

This ranks #1 for “multiple sclerosis therapy Montclair ca”. These pages are how you rank for dozens and hundreds of keywords and have these pages ranking front page for any and every service your client offers. That + my designs + my expertise in making a site load instantly and score 100/100 on google page speed scores and satisfy all of google core vital metrics for ranking I can make a website rank front page.

I can do all that without being an SEO specialist. I focus on the fundamentals and what google wants to see. Sure traditional SEO helps like backlinks, blogs, guest posting, and content creation and outreach. But if you don’t have the budget for that then you can get by focusing on the stuff you can control on the page.

These content silos are bitchin for running ads to as well. They convert VERY well. Run an ad for interior painting services and send them to the interior painting services page. The user clicks on an ad for that and is taken to a page that talks all about it and they find exactly what they came there for. Most small business owners send ads to their home page. But when someone goes there they have to go  looking for that service they clicked on the ad for. And if it’s not there they bounce. And then the business owner wonders why none of their ads are converting.

You can offer this as a freelancer who only uses html and css. These are things you can do right now and offer. These are things that small businesses WANT from the people that make their site but many of them only get half assed themeforest flips from cheap devs with no care to page speed, optimizations, or content strategy. Once you get into it, it all just becomes an assembly line of repeatable steps you do over and over again. That’s how it is for me. And so you can see what’s possible with html and css, here’s some sites I made using only that

No fancy frameworks. No react or tailwind. Just html and css and clean organized code. You can also give this a read to prepare yourself for freelancing if you wanna go that route. It’s a guide I wrote on everything you need to do to run a successful freelance agency from how to find clients, make sales calls, how to sell yourself, how to find designers and how to work with them, invoicing, etc. 

https://codestitch.app/complete-guide-to-freelancing

This is how I run my agency and how I built it. Let me know if you have any questions about it. 

As for a job. Html and css jobs exist. That’s my current full time job. I build dental websites all day for a large agency. No JavaScript for me. I just make the front end.  It’s rare, and not easy to find jobs like that. But they exist! To broaden your employment prospects you’ll need JavaScript and at least 1 framework - react or angular or vue. And node would be a nice cherry on top. 

Otherwise freelancing is your best bet. I do about $120k-$130k a year on my agency and I run it part time. Half of that is monthly subscriptions. Websites I sold for $0 down $150 a month. It’s been very popular with clients and I get residual passive income. So I only need to sell like 1 lump sum site a month to make almost $10k that month with my subscription revenue. It’s not as stressful and very manageable with a full time job. 

So yeah, plenty you can do with html and css. I think I’ve pretty much took it to its limits.","<div class=""md""><p>A lot! I’m a freelancer and I only know and use html and css.

459,oddballr,"Sorry to barge in like this. I'm a freelance graphic designer who obsessively got into HTML & CSS and found out, I love the process of building websites. I actually want to sell it as a productized service and came to the conclusion of website subscriptions. A quick search lead to you on so many threads. Really appreciate you giving back to everyone!

My question is, with a quick Google search, I find loads of services offering the same thing even for as little as €15,- per month (at least 6 companies *near me* selling for €15-50). Not sure if this is just my country (I'm from the Netherlands), but doesn't that make something like a €99 package a tough sell?

I kinda don't know how to compete with that, seeing those agencies even offer 1-day delivery services, 24/7 customer support, basically the same bells & whistles. They're usually WordPress websites, but in the client's eyes they still get the same end result, a professional and functioning website.

461,Citrous_Oyster,"There’s a huge difference in the quality of the site you get with those prices. Ask the client, how do you think they make money by charging so little? Is it because they’re so good at what they do? If they are then why are they charging so little? Great skill costs money, and the lower you charge the less time you need to spend on the site to make a profit on it. So for €15 a month, do you really think they’re putting their best effort into making your site or do you think they’re going to try and maximize their profits and spend as little time and care into your site as possible? Because at those rates it’s impossible to put a lot of effort into the site. 

Then I tell them why i cost what I cost. I custom code everything line by line. No page builders. This makes my work better than page builders because they load instantly and make Google happy. Google recently launched its core vitals update that heavily favored mobile performance and speed in their search rankings. That’s where I shine. Page builders have bloated code, prone to hacking, and very messy code. Right now, your site scores (I checked theirs before calling) 34/100. This is terrible and your site won’t really rank as well as it could. My sites score 98-100 and are literally as fast as they can be, there’s no wasteful code. Everything was built with purpose. Over time this makes your website more favorable with Google and will eventually rank higher and outperform to your competition who are almost guaranteed to be using a page builder or cheap WordPress theme that’s poorly built and not optimized for mobile experiences like mine are. My sites are custom-built and designed to convert traffic into customers by satisfying Google’s metrics and making the best performing mobile site you can have with keyword-rich content to get picked up in search results. And for every second of load time, you lose more and more customers who didn’t want to wait. When it loads instantly, we don’t lose those people. They can get to the site and convert into a sale instead of bailing after a few seconds. I also do with this a very specific formula in which I structure my website to maximize conversions. There’s a specific order you place your content in and how you write about it that funnels visitors into a sale. They’re called website conversion funnels, and I use their principles to design more effective websites. You can’t just throw whatever you want up and expect it to work. It’s all very calculated, purposeful, and deliberate. That is the difference between me and the page builders or other people who might have called you this month. I actually care about the work I put out and put thought into it. I even hire a copywriter to write all your content for you that is keyword researched and designed to be engaging, get picked up in search engines, and get people to contact you.”","<div class=""md""><p>There’s a huge difference in the quality of the site you get with those prices.

I was viewing the page on mobile earlier. When I look at it with desktop - there is no problem.

The problem with mobile is that there is no reference because of the small screen. I assumed the timeline would flow chronologically and became a little confused halfway down, and had to scroll around to figure out what was going on. Probably a few ways you could avoid this without reversing the timeline - maybe a fixed reference bar that indicates current ----- past.

600,Mentalpopcorn,"Html is markup. It seems easy because it is easy. All you're doing is describing the content of a document. It's like saying, my wall has two paintings and a bookshelf, the bookshelf has ten books, the books have 100 pages, etc.

        <Painting></Painting>
        <Bookshelf>
            <Book></Book>

CSS may seem easy now but it's more complex. Not mindfully difficult but more complex than the easy basics.


WordPress is difficult because WordPress is programming. Neither html or css are programming, in that you're not writing instructions, but rather you're writing descriptions. 

While it's definitely possible to learn WordPress before learning PHP, if you want to be a programmer, you should start with the language not the framework.

Also, ignore the guy that said not to ditch dreamweaver and definitely ditch it.  No serious developer uses that nonsense.  Phpstorm/Webstorm are great IDEs. Less powerful ones like VS Code or Adobe Brackets are good for beginners.","<div class=""md""><p>Html is markup. It seems easy because it is easy.

611,Mentalpopcorn,"Respectfully, this is the wrong approach and attitude.  In the early heydey of the internet, people wrote pages with just HTML and CSS and ran into all sorts of problems with maintainability.  Frameworks like WordPress were invented to help alleviate these problems, and you ignore them at your own peril.

For a practical example, let's say that down the road your company gets a new logo.  With a static site, you have to go through the footer and change it on every page.  Sounds easy, but it's annoying because it applies to any change you want to make.

In fact, you're likely to run into this when designing your header and footer.  Maybe you look at it and decide you want to tweak something.  ok, do it 5 times.  Another tweak? 5 more times.

Another example: let's say you've got a list of things, say it's a restaurant and every dish has a description and a name and they're in a div.  With a static site for a restaurant with 20 menu items, that's at least 80 lines of code right there.  Any time you want to make a change, or add something somewhere, you have to go through all this nonsense to find it, adjust it, and hope you don't break anything. 

With a PHP or a JS framework, it's just a few lines of code, akin to something like

    $dishes = getDishes();
    foreach($dishes as $dish) :
        <div>
             <h2>$dish->title<h2>
             <p>$dish->description</p>
        </div
    end foreach;
        
That's it.  Then on the back end you have an area where you can add/remove/change dishes using an easy to use interface rather than having to code anything.

Now, I do understand that you're not trying to be a coder and so you're not interested in learning to code. That's totally legit.  However, let me tell you as a developer who started off building a website for his family's restaurant in the 90s: you're going to have a shitty time maintaining HTML and CSS unless it's a SUPER simple site.  I.e. just a landing page with some contact info.

You'll be much better off picking a theme you like and then having a Wordpress dev customize it to your business and build you some custom fields that you can use to easily add/remove stuff, or as I mentioned, try out Divy.","<div class=""md""><p>Respectfully, this is the wrong approach and attitude.

So there's a server-side language called PHP, and it can't be seen in inspect or source code.

As far as I know, Google Forms' written questions are the only thing you can cheat on. If you press `Ctrl+U` and scroll down, you should see

`[1870334847,""Type your answer here"",null,0,[[887816666,null,1,null,[[4,301,[""7/20""],""Try Again""]]]]],[663278317,null,null,8,null,-2],[593138570,null,null,11,null,null,[""12TtaLIOjd-KVytl-OHHbnkv48HUcpq8tdYBMgiajXJi8eGM"",0,[711,400,0]]],[1252817690,null,null,8],[1587101682,null,null,11,null,null,[""1dK7I1T7VYHw-WAunPFANr7lf1RwXM0CVumVNgss4MPxmxVU"",0,[711,400,0]]],[352999836,""Type your answer here"",null,0,[[1840728017,null,1,null,[[4,301,[""-5/6""],"" Try Again""]]]]],[113727131,null,null,8],[1406157056,null,null,11,null,null,[""1h-aDdCmI46Vyyno1oWsxNL4FH8MgdUDcgM1mTvzpY3Y5N-k"",0,[711,400,0]]],[`

700,,"Alright, so you're going to get more of an answer here than you were probably looking for, but it's very important stuff. As a bit of background, I have been working in this industry for over a decade now, both in the hosting and web development fields, so this is not only coming from my personal experience, but a lot of what I'm about to say is commonplace practice/opinions of other experienced industry people:

1. Personally I would avoid Godaddy or any brand operated by [EIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_International_Group). I actually worked for the latter as a hosting tech for the better part of 3 years, and all the negative crap you read about them online is true, but it's even worse than people realize. I would highly recommend moving your domain away from GD ASAP, but keep in mind if you do this before it's set to renew, you will have to pay another registration fee, and godaddy will not prorate you. That said you likely only paid 0.99, and after your first year you're going to pay likely ~$15 anyway. I personally cannot recommend [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) enough. They even have a lot of one-click tools for beginners, and their support and features are top-shelf!

2. For managed hosting (ie not running your own server\*) simple websites that don't require backend functionality in the same environment — which sounds like your scenario —  I highly recommend taking the time to learn how to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  Not only is it free, but can be a great introduction to git; if you want to pursue web development further, this is an indispensable, and basically essential skill to have. With a bit of reading, though, even a beginner can get their page on Github in a matter of 10-15 minutes, which in my experience is even quicker than messing around with stupid Cpanel nonsense, or trying to navigate the annoyances of SFTP.

Try to stay away from a lot of the companies located at the top of the search engine results when trying to find hosting recommendations. Try hanging around the webdev subreddits and see what people there are using, or recommend. If you have any specific questions about either of my points, let me know and I'll help where I can :)

702,MPair-E,"You've gotten a lot of good advice, but as far as *your exact situation*, here is what I'd do:

1) Indeed, you need to purchase hosting. A domain is just an address that *points* to your hosting (where your code lives). SO...I'd suggest buying an Economy hosting plan from Godaddy (should be around $5/month). 

2) You can ignore the upsells about backup/malware scanning, and ignore the specialized hosting (like their 'Wordpress Hosting' plans)--we just want straight-up economy Linux hosting. You're a beginner learning HTML and this is all you need to worry about right now. You can learn to use things like Git/pages at a point when you've actually gotten the syntax down (I'm really reading into the 'learning HTML' bit of your title). However, one thing that *will* benefit you at this point (which you'll receive with this economy plan), is having a robust-enough hosting plan to let you brush up against stuff like cpanel, and give you access to phpadmin if necessary--even if you're not sure what those things are yet.

3) It's very easy to link two godaddy properties together when they're already under the same account, particularly because you won't have to worry about stuff like DNS records/nameservers, which is again something you probably don't need to be focusing on when learning the basics. Once you purchase the hosting, it'll say something like 'Congrats on your new hosting! What do you want to do now?' and you'll want to basically ignore any sort of 'use our website builder'/GoDaddy-branded fluff, and instead just connect your hosting to your domain/domain to hosting. 

4) We're doing this because we basically want to get you to the point of having cpanel up and in front of you, which is what you'll have the option of doing once you've gotten through the initial Godaddy setup. Don't know what cpanel is? Don't worry about it. The main thing to note right now is it's a hub where you'll basically have all the info/options you'll need to proceed from here, whether you want to use a content management system like Wordpress, or just upload/access plain-text HTML pages.

5) From cpanel we can a) very easily install Wordpress and get you logged into the Wordpress CMS to start building, if that's your preference. Or b) We'll be able to very quickly look up the info you need for FTP access (IP address, username [mentioned on cpanel dashboard], and password [changeable from cpanel dashbaord] is all you need, which you can access/change all from within cpanel--don't need to worry about port with this plan, and don't worry about actually creating an FTP 'user'). From here you can use a client like Filezilla to easily upload files/directories to your server root, as you're probably used to.

Presumably you'll be comfortable in one of these environments when it comes to learning HTML/getting your page up, but let me know if you have any questions from here.

This is definitely the case, and they will try to upsell services to you that you either:

1. Don't actually need, and are often marketed using spooky buzzwords to scare you into subscribing to the service, and the few times where there may be validity to the buzzwords being used (backups, etc) they are more often than not implemented poorly and don't work as advertised. 

2. Will actively complicate your learning journey as they abstract far too much of the process away for the beginner web developer, and as is the case with my first point, often implemented poorly 

This is why I advised against going with the first page of Google results when searching for web hosts as a lot of them realised it's smarter to spend money on marketing than infrastructure, which with enough money and savvy — which these companies have in excess — ensures high search results. With all those things considered, don't beat yourself over your choice! You don't know what you don't know, and there is a lot of forces working against the uninitiated to push them in the direction you've been steered towards. You're simply the victim of predatory industry practices.


> I am going to setup with Github as I have been hearing that almost exclusively here!

Good call, and I'm super glad that others have recommended the same! It's such ana amazing resource to have, and great learning tool for someone in your position to better understand the daily details of web development. 

As always, let me know if you have any questions, or need any help with anything along the way :)

Example:

The 4 possible results are Stupid, Ugly, Annoying, Smelly

question: Where do you like to hang out?

answers:

A. The garbage dump (+3 Smelly, +1 Stupid)

B. Comic-con (-2 Stupid, +1 Ugly, +1 Annoying, +1 Smelly)

C. Katy Perry concert (+3 Stupid, +3 Annoying, -2 Ugly)

D. Your girlfriend's room (+5 Ugly)

790,pookage,"The good news is that *things have gotten a lot easier since 1999* \- the bad news is that *things can now get much more complicated* \- webtech has transformed into something with basically limitless potential and, as a result, can be quite overwhelming to learn if you look at it as a single behemoth.

Looking at your site and seeing `<table>` layouts and the `<center>` tag, my recommendation would be:

* Refamiliarise yourself with HTML - in 2008 we got HTML5 (now just 'HTML' as there are no-longer version numbers for html), which fully-transitioned it away from mixed-markup-and-styling and purely into semantics - as a result there's a lot of new semantic tags, which is awesome and you can descibe things suuuper accurately!  Seeing as you're already familiar with how HTML works, you might as well just head to [the MDN element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and just poke about!  Pay particular attention to the 'content sectioning' elements, as they will provide the context for the other text and inline text elements.
* It looks like you haven't had a chance to learn CSS yet - which is exciting! As HTML no-longer covers styling, all of that responsibility is moved to CSS, which has become an absolute pleasure to write - both in how concise and how powerful it can be.  [MDN has your basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) covered there, too!  Feel free to seek-out help here on reddit over at /r/css and /r/learncss.
* Javascript is the last part of the web-tech holy trinity - it looks like you're familiar with it through google tag manager and twitter embeds, but if HTML says what the content *is*, and CSS says how the content *looks*, then JS is what the website *does* \- allowing you to change the HTML and CSS dynamically; adding / removing / updating elements on your page based on user-input or other events.  JS is easy to learn but has a lot of depth to it, with both HTML and CSS ensuring that they have a JS interface for each new feature they add.  Once again, [MDN will get you started on Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and if you have any questions then head to /r/learnjavascript here on reddit.

I would advise against looking for courses and tutorials unless you have very specific questions that need answering; there are a *lot* of them out there, but quality varies wildly and it will be hard for you to identify what is good and what isn't until you have the basics under your belt, and you've tried to solve some problems independently.   
 SO - let MDN show you the ropes, try to build things - and when you reach a frustration-point or are unable to progress then *that* is the best time to reach for google and youtube, as you'll know specifically what it is you're wanting to learn.

In terms of software - if you're coming from notepad then [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is probably the next step up on the rung, with some helpful auto-complete and syntax highlighting to create a pleasant development experience for you, while still largely behaving the same way that notepad does.  Once you reach the limitations of what it can offer you and you find yourself looking for a full IDE, then [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) seems to have emerged as the industry-standard for web-development - but it's glut of features will hinder more than it will help you at this stage; I'm just putting it on your radar so that you know it exists.

Good luck, and don't be shy about coming back to ask questions about HTML semantics here, CSS over at /r/css, and JS over at /r/learnjavascript!

791,itsnotlupus,"A few extra bits of advice, in no particular order:

- Your browser dev tools are now your best friend. Ctrl-Shift-I should open them, or you can fish them out in your browser menu, under ""tools"" or somesuch. There is a lot going on there, you don't have to use everything right away. The console, elements, source and network tabs are the ones I use the most, by far. They allow you to poke under the hood in a way that goes far beyond ""view source""
- you can use `mdn.io` to make quick searches against the MDN site. If you're on a site, open your dev tools, look around, and see that an element has some weird CSS that draws cool border, you can just type [`mdn.io/border`](https://mdn.io/border) in a new tab to read some documentation about it.  
- running web pages from local files is a lot more broken than it used to be. a lot of that is on purpose and for good reasons, but that won't help you. you can run a local web server (and indeed some editors will do that for you), or...
- there are a bunch of sites that let you experiment with putting together some HTML+JS+CSS, like https://codepen.io/. some users publish their experiments which can show you some cool techniques. either way, it's a great little sandbox to try things.
- you mostly don't have to start writing everything from scratch anymore. some answers here are pointing at various JS frameworks, but you can go even higher level than that and just grab something like Wordpress (most modern web hosts have some point and click way of doing that), and theming it into something that looks like what you want (you can choose from many existing themes, and/or edit your own. Wordpress uses PHP on the server side, but I don't think theming requires too much knowledge of it. (I could be wrong, it's been a while.))

That's why I used the word ""even"" in there. I think folks missed that, as I was attempting to refer to both, HTML and PHP, as stuff that's 'not coding'. My fault for not being more explicit, apologies.

Almost none of what you use to write most websites is ""not coding""; it's scripting and marking-up text. The line gets blurry, fast, on what all that means. I know not everyone can do it (or I'd be without a job!), but still.

I have a ton of respect for those who live in C, C++, Java, Python and all the others out there. It's not something I care to do. It feels a ton different from the little I've dabbled in actual coding languages, and while I can do it, I can read it, I can even change stuff that I need and recompile... I'm really not much good at actually *writing* code.

992,outshyn,"So, I'm a one-person development team, building an intranet for a financial services company.  It's a small business, just 10 employees or so.  Frankly, they shouldn't have a custom-built intranet, as they're too small to afford a full-time developer.  But nonetheless, here I am, and I've built them an incredible site that manages all their clients.  It has a calendaring system, an email & text-message alert system for reminders and meetings, automated emails that go out as we move a client through various processes, huge data tracking for each client's financial info (except for certain things I refused to put in the system, like SSN and bank #s).

The thing is vast, and shows every client's businesses, every major item/resource they own, properties, taxes paid, and so on.  I'm proud of it.

But I am not an artist.  I was in fact the UX Director for a company for a while, and I had ""Web Designer"" as a title for a few years back at the dawn of the Internet, but for the most part I'm just a PHP/MySQL developer who needs to lay out pages cleanly and sensibly.  I don't want to have to re-invent pop-up modals.  I don't want to have to invent alert colors or highlight colors for when the user fails to fill out a form correctly.  I don't want to have to get pixel-perfect placement of my content via micro-managing CSS.  All I want is to build systems that store data and then present it in a nice clean grid.  I want the data to look intuitive, clustered/grouped sensibly, everything lined up in ways that an accountant would find gratifying.

And right now, that means Bootstrap is damn near perfect.  All the UI, which I am not qualified nor interested to custom-build myself, is handled.  Everything is consistent.  My ""wild"" design is that I eventually added in Font Awesome icons and a few extra colors.  And honestly, that's really enough.  The owner of the business doesn't want to pay for creative design or cool Web sites.  He wants to pay for functionality with simple layouts.

1044,SilentDis,"1. Knowing everything.  
Couldn't agree more. The speed at which you pick up new skills is, by far, more important than what you know going into a project. Even in something as seemingly 'simple' as web development, as soon as you cross into stuff like reactive design, schema, and dynamic pages, just assume you'll have to relearn how to do your whole job every 6 months at minimum. Between how fast the tech moves, how fast tools come out, how fast methodology changes, and just general desire from client and web user alike, if you're using 'tricks' you learned 6 months ago, your pages are bloated and ancient.
2. Modular code.  
This becomes insanely important as sites grow in complexity. Again, on the simple end, you don't want to re-code your menus every time, or even re-write a function in some bit of PHP or JS. And, when you refactor (PHP8 is out, wee!), you don't want to refactor 10 times, let alone the hundreds if it's something common.
3. Reference docs.  
I agree with this in principle. Generally speaking, you always want to take the examples you find and re-code them to work better for your particular instance. Having said that, grabbing a layout or template from somewhere is kind of the name of the game. Look to your competition, see what they're doing, then match or best them. Sometimes, that means just saying 'screw it' and using a WordPress install with a theme because it cuts your dev time in 1/4 than from doing it from scratch. (this is variable, depending on if you're an in-house coder, a freelancer, or a contractor, of course)

Overall, this is absolutely a solid set of things to consider when you're going from just writing out the HTML for a couple pages into a theme engine, then again into a bespoke environment written in PHP and Node.JS (don't ask, I still have nightmares about that monstrosity).","<div class=""md""><ol>

No not at all! In fact that could help you a lot by starting out at that age. But are you right, it could get complicated if you jump right in without help or a plan.

In programming the first thing that is important is to know fundamentals and theory of programming. The fundamentals could be like what is a variable, what is a for loop, what is a function and so on. 

Also try not to rush your self when you are learning something new and if you can find someone who can help you or could also be interested in learning programing, that could be the biggest advantage for both of you!

I have some videos on where and how you could get started (take a look at them as I think they may help you to guide you in the right direction).

>A __single-page application__ (__SPA__), is a [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) or [web site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site) that fits on a single [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application. In a SPA, either all necessary code – [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) – is retrieved with a single page load,  or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although modern web technologies (such as those included in the [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) [pushState() API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(HTML5\)#APIs)) can provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) behind the scenes.

everytime you get a project you will get a new challenge. don't worry about what you know how to code and what you dont because each project will require you to learn or do something new.

there are a lot of plugins that do the work for you. In a way that is bad because then you do not do the coding but in a way it is good because you can see what coding was done on your behalf in the plugin files and then you can filter and hook into them from you themes functions etc.

OTHERWISE you would have to code it all yourself, which can be nice because then you have 100% control but ALSO you have to remember EVERY feature you want and take EVER caution in your own code for security and best practices etc.

All this applies to Drupal, Joomla!, and any other CMS. Or if you build YOUR OWN CMS or just a site with no CMS then your work flow will be larger but you have more control and then you could consider being a FULL STACK developer and using version control resources like GitHub and Putty (unlike WinSCP for FTP Putty is SSH for minifying and concatenation etc) and have a bunch of dependencies that get all rolled into like 1 CSS and 1 JS for faster performance etc.

AND NOW IF you can do LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL and PHP) shared hosting set ups with FTP to WinSCP etc then you can make a little money making porfolio sites but not much cuz a lot of people use Squarespace etc but if you can go full stack like NGINX etc then you are looking a salary of 50+ and the middle ground is very dodgey like you gotta really beat the pavement to find clients.

Full Stack developers work in house with corporations or design firms etc. OR they have their own firm and can charge 3-5K a website to other corporations that needs high level features or just want that high price peace of mind but they want to see credentials that reflect a skill level that gives them that piece of mind. That goes into how you dress, what laptop you bring to meetings, you haircut, and your willingness to work in house or be flexible etc.

Don't be  a slacker. Learning VirtualBox and having ISO images of WordPress installs etc that get you basically all the way to the project features customization and content phase etc will all save time and make you a better developer. Developing locally on your own computer saves money in hosting - then launch to hosting when you are finished.

Good Luck! Be careful about wasting time on unbillable hours in learning etc. Charge for email and phone communication to make up for it. I fell short of many of these ideas and didn't make as much money as I could have etc. You don't want to be lazy and write everything twice (wet), you want to be professional and don't repeat yourself (dry) - Stay dry. You can code in any language just by pattern recognition if you code WET but once you can code DRY then you know you are familiar with the language. 

Coding DRY goes hand in hand with dependency management and version control - saving time by reusing the tried and true.","<div class=""md""><p>if you learn wordpress then you get to use PHP, CSS, and JS AND HTML etc.first, just setting up a site to have like SSL and working email that doesn&#39;t go into spam.then, a user profile site like buddypress, or a shop like woocommerce, or an event calendar with front end posting etc.</p>

<p>AND NOW IF you can do LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL and PHP) shared hosting set ups with FTP to WinSCP etc then you can make a little money making porfolio sites but not much cuz a lot of people use Squarespace etc but if you can go full stack like NGINX etc then you are looking a salary of 50+ and the middle ground is very dodgey like you gotta really beat the pavement to find clients.</p>

<p>Full Stack developers work in house with corporations or design firms etc. OR they have their own firm and can charge 3-5K a website to other corporations that needs high level features or just want that high price peace of mind but they want to see credentials that reflect a skill level that gives them that piece of mind. That goes into how you dress, what laptop you bring to meetings, you haircut, and your willingness to work in house or be flexible etc.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be  a slacker. Learning VirtualBox and having ISO images of WordPress installs etc that get you basically all the way to the project features customization and content phase etc will all save time and make you a better developer. Developing locally on your own computer saves money in hosting - then launch to hosting when you are finished.</p>

<p>Good Luck! Be careful about wasting time on unbillable hours in learning etc. Charge for email and phone communication to make up for it. I fell short of many of these ideas and didn&#39;t make as much money as I could have etc. You don&#39;t want to be lazy and write everything twice (wet), you want to be professional and don&#39;t repeat yourself (dry) - Stay dry. You can code in any language just by pattern recognition if you code WET but once you can code DRY then you know you are familiar with the language. </p>

<p>Coding DRY goes hand in hand with dependency management and version control - saving time by reusing the tried and true.</p>

1109,Individual-Writing56,make a website. on that website have an area that has a list of images that are basically screenshots of the projects you did or websites you built. include links (that open in a new tab or pop up modal window) so people can see your work. That is pretty much it. You could include your own description about the project or how much it cost or how long it took. For my portfolio I just put an image of the site as a screenshot and put a link on it so they can click and view it in a new tab. that way your site is still open on another tab and racking up time decreasing bounce rate which is good for SEO of your portfolio.,"<div class=""md""><p>make a website. on that website have an area that has a list of images that are basically screenshots of the projects you did or websites you built. include links (that open in a new tab or pop up modal window) so people can see your work.
