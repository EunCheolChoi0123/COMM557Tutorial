\- Reach out to the recruiter or an individual person at your target company, explain in 2 sentences why you want to work there, and ask if they're willing to do a referral

\- Networking events / meetups to meet more folks

54,kaumaron,"Yeah. I used to be a teacher so I'm biased towards PBL (Project based learning). I always recommend trying to design a project end to end around something you care about and using the tool you want to learn. It's motivating, since you want to solve the problem; it encourages depth of learning, since you run into real world problems; and it's compelling -- when you talk about it, you'll know all the details, be excited and show you can manage a project on a bigger scale.

PBL is much harder than a course and you likely need to start with something so a course is a good first step but make sure you apply what you've learned (PBL's main benefit).

For example, back in 2015/2016 I built a news aggregation tool that would link stories about the same topic from disparate sources together with a goal of unbiasing the news. I had to learn AWS to run the code and store the results and host a website; NLP to accomplish the task; orchestration for the process; and a bit of business since I was hoping to turn it into a product. I learned a few things: I love NLP and it's applications, I like DE more than DS, and I could be pretty decent on the business side of things. That's very different than any outcome I've gotten from datacamp, codecademy, Udemy, etc.

<p>- Consider applying to smaller startups and medium sized companies. They. Are. Always. Hiring. Boom, bust, etc.</p>

75,AbnDist,"I worked previously in criminal justice research and analytics. A lot of the work that I saw then was less about predicting *crimes* and more about guiding *policy*. For instance, many jurisdictions throughout the United States use Pretrial Risk Assessment tools to help judges determine what form of pretrial release to offer defendants (as an example, the tool they use in NYC: [https://www.nycja.org/release-assessment](https://www.nycja.org/release-assessment)  ). The closest thing I've seen to actual *prediction* was a jurisdiction that used a predictive tool for recidivism on a narrow slice of cases in order to allocate resources for victims. 

&#x200B;

Beyond that, many jurisdictions are indeed primarily focused on summary data analyses - less focus on prediction, and more on getting an idea of what's happening on the ground for purposes of politics and policy. You'd be surprised how many places in the US have no idea how many people they arrest each year and on what charges, or what percentage of cases go to trial vs taking a plea, or what the cost of pretrial detention is to the city each year. It's not as sexy as doing prediction, but answering questions of this type can have a very big impact: in hot button topics like bail reform, I've seen very short turnaround times between an analyst generating a statistic and that statistic ending up in a press release in support of some policy or other. 

&#x200B;

In public policy in general, a lot of the analytic work I've seen would look more familiar to an economist than an ML researcher. Causal inference & observational analyses are widespread, with only the occasional random control trial where it can be ethically justified. There's a growing appetite for evidence based decision making, but it's still not *predictive* work - it's inferential statistics, determining which policies are most effective and for whom.

82,WadeEffingWilson,"I can't speak to LE but I can regarding cybersecurity which is a massive industry that focuses heavily on activity that falls into the same bucket. There are concentrated focus areas that identify, track, and report on specific entities (state-sponsored adversaries, financially-motivated crime syndicates, hactivists, counter-intel groups, etc) and their tradecraft (specific malware/tools, tactics/techniques/procedures, killchains).

From the defender side, ML is leveraged to gain insights, recognize patterns, and extract anomalies that might indicate intrusions, attacks, or internal threats from massive amounts of noisy data. Behavioral analysis can create heuristic signatures that can be used to identify questionable or malicious traffic where typical indicators are too dynamic to track or accurately predict. For particular activity (whether known-good or known-bad), classifiers can be trained on labeled data. Given the rapidly changing nature of network data and activity, there's usually a shelf life on labeled traffic, especially if the attacker thinks that they have been detected.

Time series analysis can offer some very interesting capabilities for finding illegitimate activity by either detecting unique signals in the traffic or disparities between predicted forecasts and what actually happened (time and volume domain anomalies).

Similarly, neural networks are leveraged given their higher plasticity and broader range for time series analysis, anomaly detection, or classification problems.

Technically sophisticated attackers employ similar tradecraft for recon, fingerprinting, and baselining for detection avoidance. These advanced persistent threats (APTs) present the most significant threat and are the most difficult to detect. On top of counter-intel, attackers will attempt to disrupt and alter traffic to trash models if they believe ML is being used as a defense mechanism (eg, boiled frog attacks, smoke screens, false flag ops). I create a ton of various ML models on live production networks and I can say that being able to take on APT level ML right now is a moonshot. In the meantime, there's enough work to be done defending against the nonstop attacks and late-breaking vulnerabilities that reveal massive network compromises that have allowed persistent access over a significant period of time.

Broadly, AI/ML is still shiny and most security practitioners don't know how or where to leverage it yet. My primary focus is operationalizing ML strategically to enhance defender capabilities and also to provide a means to use it tactically (which is far more fun, IMO), equipping front-line defenders with the knowledge and skills to maximize their efforts.","<div class=""md""><p>I can&#39;t speak to LE but I can regarding cybersecurity which is a massive industry that focuses heavily on activity that falls into the same bucket. There are concentrated focus areas that identify, track, and report on specific entities (state-sponsored adversaries, financially-motivated crime syndicates, hactivists, counter-intel groups, etc) and their tradecraft (specific malware/tools, tactics/techniques/procedures, killchains).</p>

<p>From the defender side, ML is leveraged to gain insights, recognize patterns, and extract anomalies that might indicate intrusions, attacks, or internal threats from massive amounts of noisy data. Behavioral analysis can create heuristic signatures that can be used to identify questionable or malicious traffic where typical indicators are too dynamic to track or accurately predict. For particular activity (whether known-good or known-bad), classifiers can be trained on labeled data. Given the rapidly changing nature of network data and activity, there&#39;s usually a shelf life on labeled traffic, especially if the attacker thinks that they have been detected.</p>

<p>Time series analysis can offer some very interesting capabilities for finding illegitimate activity by either detecting unique signals in the traffic or disparities between predicted forecasts and what actually happened (time and volume domain anomalies).</p>

<p>Similarly, neural networks are leveraged given their higher plasticity and broader range for time series analysis, anomaly detection, or classification problems.</p>

<p>Technically sophisticated attackers employ similar tradecraft for recon, fingerprinting, and baselining for detection avoidance. These advanced persistent threats (APTs) present the most significant threat and are the most difficult to detect. On top of counter-intel, attackers will attempt to disrupt and alter traffic to trash models if they believe ML is being used as a defense mechanism (eg, boiled frog attacks, smoke screens, false flag ops). I create a ton of various ML models on live production networks and I can say that being able to take on APT level ML right now is a moonshot. In the meantime, there&#39;s enough work to be done defending against the nonstop attacks and late-breaking vulnerabilities that reveal massive network compromises that have allowed persistent access over a significant period of time.</p>

The tool would spit out a name but it couldn't determine whether the person was likely to be a victim of gun violence or the shooter (as a side note, this is pretty much the plot of the TV show Person of Interest).

What do you think criminals in the neighborhood think if they see the police showing up at your house multiple times to talk but you're never arrested?

They assume that you're a snitch.

The end result was that Robert got shot twice because people thought he was a snitch, because the police kept coming to his house, because the algorithm predicted he would get shot or be a shooter.

173,clifmars,"If you have ANY material involvement, you are an author.  Period.

Person that writes the article gets primary.  Folks that edited it or provided the data or the novel means to collect the data (i.e., wrote the software) get placed beyond this.

Acknowledgment goes towards folks that have been helpful to you and your research — without actually being a part of it.  

In my youth, I hated writing.  I loved building systems.  My mentor really had no idea of what I was working on — he just knew that if he paid me, I'd do amazing things.  I did a lot of work with item response theory and modal bayesian systems.  Got bored after the university sold my work without telling me, with the technology transfer cash going to my professor (25% went straight to him as an 'inventor')...and then a latent semantic analysis project that went to populating a MI model that I spent five years developing until it was sold to college board.  Again, others making a lot of money and patents...and nothing for me.

In a lot of cases, I actually was an editor on these papers — not so much about writing things, but making sure that folks that knew nothing about the innerworkings got it right.  Most of the time they didn't.  But I didn't actually 'write' anything...

As a result, a LOT of acknowledgments...few real credits.  

30 years later, APA and other guidelines now directly state how to credit people.  In the case of OP, it sounds like he should have been at least the second author.  The professor should have been third.  

A lot of times, professors will dangle authorship to new grad students...they will offer a position they never actually earned. This is what had happened to me in multiple times...I'm off the project, moved on elsewhere, the grad student uses my notes and writings from my lab — to write things up.  Get primary authorship, the professor gets second, and then the folks that did all the rest...somewhere in the third category or just acknowledged.

I'm a bit salty about this 30 years later...mostly because I can prove my involvement and the genesis of these projects — but I also don't care enough to do so.  Because it would take real effort for little reward, it still bites me in the ass sometimes when I bring up a project — and someone fact-checks it and then either doesn't contact me about the fact-check OR assumes I'm full of shit.

Sooooo....if I were OP...I'd get it straightened out.  I would contact the professor, the dean, and the publication.  I've had to help folks at my institution deal with this.  In one case, a professor was involved with a technology transfer of the product — and had applied for a patent on the methodology, because of how the patent system — he is still the named inventor.  However, the professor gets none of the money coming from it.  And the student now got their credit in the journals — and the money the university was funneling to the professor.

TL;DR — the project was originally submitted as a part of the student.  Student left the working group.  Project resubmitted elsewhere — this means regardless of the words on the page, unless the paper SIGNIFICANTLY deviated from the earlier work (and still referenced the work — not just acknowledgment) — the student was an author.","<div class=""md""><p>If you have ANY material involvement, you are an author.

<p>Person that writes the article gets primary.  Folks that edited it or provided the data or the novel means to collect the data (i.e., wrote the software) get placed beyond this.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment goes towards folks that have been helpful to you and your research — without actually being a part of it.  </p>

<p>In my youth, I hated writing.  I loved building systems.  My mentor really had no idea of what I was working on — he just knew that if he paid me, I&#39;d do amazing things.  I did a lot of work with item response theory and modal bayesian systems.  Got bored after the university sold my work without telling me, with the technology transfer cash going to my professor (25% went straight to him as an &#39;inventor&#39;)...and then a latent semantic analysis project that went to populating a MI model that I spent five years developing until it was sold to college board.  Again, others making a lot of money and patents...and nothing for me.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases, I actually was an editor on these papers — not so much about writing things, but making sure that folks that knew nothing about the innerworkings got it right.  Most of the time they didn&#39;t.  But I didn&#39;t actually &#39;write&#39; anything...</p>

<p>As a result, a LOT of acknowledgments...few real credits.  </p>

<p>30 years later, APA and other guidelines now directly state how to credit people.  In the case of OP, it sounds like he should have been at least the second author.  The professor should have been third.  </p>

<p>A lot of times, professors will dangle authorship to new grad students...they will offer a position they never actually earned. This is what had happened to me in multiple times...I&#39;m off the project, moved on elsewhere, the grad student uses my notes and writings from my lab — to write things up.  Get primary authorship, the professor gets second, and then the folks that did all the rest...somewhere in the third category or just acknowledged.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit salty about this 30 years later...mostly because I can prove my involvement and the genesis of these projects — but I also don&#39;t care enough to do so.  Because it would take real effort for little reward, it still bites me in the ass sometimes when I bring up a project — and someone fact-checks it and then either doesn&#39;t contact me about the fact-check OR assumes I&#39;m full of shit.</p>

<p>Sooooo....if I were OP...I&#39;d get it straightened out.  I would contact the professor, the dean, and the publication.  I&#39;ve had to help folks at my institution deal with this.  In one case, a professor was involved with a technology transfer of the product — and had applied for a patent on the methodology, because of how the patent system — he is still the named inventor.  However, the professor gets none of the money coming from it.  And the student now got their credit in the journals — and the money the university was funneling to the professor.</p>

<p>TL;DR — the project was originally submitted as a part of the student.  Student left the working group.  Project resubmitted elsewhere — this means regardless of the words on the page, unless the paper SIGNIFICANTLY deviated from the earlier work (and still referenced the work — not just acknowledgment) — the student was an author.</p>

There's been some pretty big issues with journals of freezing to retract papers despite very severe questions about the integrity of the data, issues around authorship, and all sorts of other related things.

What exactly makes you an expert? Do you have any idea how the academic publishing system works? It's not built around integrity, it's built around profit. Even the editors, who are largely academics, are highly resistant to the idea that a paper should be retracted or modified once it's been published without substantial evidence to support that retraction. 

And even in the face of substantial evidence and issues such as image manipulation which appear to be quite prominent, it takes a tremendous amount of outcry and effort to get a journal to actually retract to paper.

<li>Technically you should get into a software devellopement mindset of delivering a &quot;product&quot;: Typically a well structured and documented code (versioned + CI/CD) to deploy an https model endpoint) that is versionned.

And if I had to guess, I’d say you won’t see sufficient performance increases on your calculations to justify it enough to your mom to buy you a new gaming PC build. 

If you’re truly thinking this will need to run for days (per training iteration) you’ll basically just roast a consumer card anyways.

Then if you really need gpu, you’re not in consumer gaming card territory, you’re in workstation or dedicated board territory. You’ll want some decent power supply redundancy and batteries to at least bring everything down nice if you have a power failure mid training cycle. 

Ohhhh and some good air conditioning. I tortured my 2080Ti for a week in my closet a few years ago playing with LSTM training. Shit got too hot and wasn’t worth “the experiment.”

301,noobshitlord,"I applied for a few Data Science bootcamps (CodeOp, IronHack, Code First Girls, Le Wagon, etc) and got accepted to all of them - which given the reputation of bootcamps as money making mills, I'm not surprised.  
  
Of the in person bootcamps, I chose Le Wagon because it was closer to my house, it was an in person, intense, full time class, and the syllabus seemed to cover more bases that I could dive into deeper later, and because it came with an income share agreement. It was also the hardest test I had to take, and needed a full two weeks to even pass on a retake. It also had the best reputation from the region I'm in.  
  
My problem is that there was one program that provided a completely free experience that I had applied for weeks before any of the others, and it was sponsored by a company, without guaranteeing a role. That is CFG -- I originally applied for just Code First Girls Degree, but saw that the response was taking forever so I ended up applying to others in the meantime as I needed to start learning ASAP from living off my savings and being an unemployed freelancer.  
  
Well, I just signed the income share agreement with Le Wagon's fund provider the other week, a total of almost EUR8,000 to be paid back once I got a job above a certain minimum threshold at 10% of my earnings/month. I was set!  
  
BUT! just today, I got shortlisted for a company sponsored spot in the CFG Degree program, which means learning online completely free, with mentorship for 16 weeks. It would have been amazing had I not already accepted other agreements just a couple weeks before. It also means that I wouldn't be paying anything, but the classes would be online, and in the evening.  
  
I am aware of the general feeling towards bootcamps in this sub, however I do need some sort of learning environment that isn't as expensive as a 4 year degree in CS, so I was hoping for some insight. My idea is to learn what I can from the bootcamp, see where I excel and struggle with, and continue learning on my own. Right now I am learning Python, reviewing probability, statistics, algebra, calculus, etc. preparing to make a gradual transition. I am also aware of the amount of competition for entry level applicants and bootcamp graduates, some idea of the realities of the job market for DS but would still like to pursue it and see where I can go from here. With that, please be kind.

I know it's a long way from what I'm doing now to being a data scientist, but I believe that anything can be learned and I have all the resources I need to access various advanced courses or connect with mentors in the field.

For a general purpose spam it everywhere resume what you have is actually okay - the more things you can mention doing the better and its potentially not worth it to remove parts of your resume to be more descriptive in other parts.

In the most condensed form - k is a number representing the number of neighbors to consider. Let’s just use k=5 here. To classify a piece of unseen data, calculate the distance of the new record to all other records. We classify the new record based on the class that was the most common in the nearest 5 neighbors. 

Calculating distance can be done in a variety of ways, but a simple strategy is just using Euclidean distance.

319,Aquiffer,"Think of variance as how much error you get when training a model and bias as how much error you get when testing a model. You want both variance and bias to be as low as possible.

If your model fails completely to relate your training variables to your target, you’ll have high variance (high training error) and high bias (high testing error). 

If you overfit a model, you’ll get a low variance (low training error), but a high bias (high testing error).

To reduce the bias, you can make it fit the training data a little less well with the expectation that it will be more generalizable. This will increase your variance, but should reduce your bias. 

If you make a model too general you may actually see both your variance and bias increase, meaning the model just doesn’t have the descriptive power necessary to make good decisions.

While this way of thinking about it is simple and pretty accurate, you might get tripped up by variance and bias in other contexts. 

To be more specific, call variance what it is because of the actual statistical concept of variance. If your model has a smaller margin of error while training, it has less “variance” between the reality and the prediction. Bias comes from the idea that we make an assumption that our training data reflects all data, including the testing data.

Follow something like that link:

* Developed X by using Y which led to Z

And put those impacts in real, financial/practical context as much as possible. For example:

* Developed a recommendation algorithm using a behavioral sequence transformer model which led to 13% higher click-through-rate (CTR).
* Built an end-to-end purchase prediction model using XGBoost and PySpark which led to 5% increase in conversion rate and $10,000,000 revenue growth year-over-year.

EDIT:
Personally I'd get rid of the job experience not related to your current field (eg. compositor). Remove those points from your summary, no one is interested in your video game experience unless you're specifically applying to video game companies.

Overall.. you need to tailor your resume to each job posting. Or at least to specific types of positions in DS. If it's viz heavy, then highlight the dashboards you've made. If it's a ML position then really detail the model results.

Your resume reads kind of confusing without a lot of focus.. that's probably part of why you're not getting feedback.","<div class=""md""><p>You have less than 10 years, try to reduce your resume to 1-page.

Probably the single biggest determinant regarding whether or not I got a call was how long the job listings had been out. If this was a job opening that was 30 days old I almost never got a call. However, if this was a job opening that was just opened a day or two earlier I usually got a call.

If a job listing is still open after 30 days you have to realize that you're behind probably a thousand or more people. Very often the only reason why they haven't closed the listing is because the person that they really want hasn't accepted the offer.  So in reality you never had a chance unless that person rejected the final offer.

He did a lot of grinding and consulting early on. It was a lot of setting up websites for mom and pop shops, helping small businesses fix their IT issues. All the while he built websites and apps on the side. None became a sustainable business, but he had a portfolio that showed he can make real things that real people use and make them from scratch. That goes a long way.

He ended up with a SWE/data job for a big corp for a couple years. He was probably making what you’re aiming for. But his career growth was limited due to lack of a degree. A guy he knew from entrepreneur circles was starting a business and asked him to come on. And now he’s the CTO of a fairly successful startup. He did go back and finish his degree eventually, sort of because he had the time (lots of flexibility in his position) and he was making good money.

So it _is_ possible to break into tech and do well without a degree. But the only way I’ve seen work is by being really f***ing useful to people. It’s a very entrepreneurial path and require lots of skills you definitely won’t learn here.

So on that note, get AWS cloud certifications maybe? Something that could solve “shit we need to fix this” issues for a variety of businesses. It may not immediately get you a 70k job.

<p>So it <em>is</em> possible to break into tech and do well without a degree. But the only way I’ve seen work is by being really f***ing useful to people. It’s a very entrepreneurial path and require lots of skills you definitely won’t learn here.</p>

<p>So on that note, get AWS cloud certifications maybe? Something that could solve “shit we need to fix this” issues for a variety of businesses. It may not immediately get you a 70k job. But you’ll learn how to make and deploy and manage actually useful shit. And that can get you there eventually.</p>

Although this is personally what I observed in my job search, it doesn't necessarily imply that you'll find the same results as I do, so take my response with a grain of salt.

I primarily apply to positions in the company's official website because to me, it guarantees that I am applying for an existing internal role that I'm interested to learn more about. Often times, websites like Indeed and sometimes LinkedIn Jobs page are outdated and would advertise nonexistent or expired roles. Applying through the company's portal also gives me a piece of mind thinking that, if considered, I'll be speaking with hiring managers who have high influence in the companies I'm interested to work with (even though applying through Workday suckkssss) 

However, someone with better social skills than myself may find networking more useful for them. Someone who's much better than me with writing cold emails to reach out to people they never spoke with may have better luck than I did on LinkedIn.

The DA > DS flow is not career progression in most companies, rather it’s moving into a different taxonomy. DS generally pays more because it’s on a different pay scale with a different set of requirements and talent pool.

tech is pretty broad... and even within it, you may be exposed to multiple niche areas.  If you're still in uni, this is a good time to explore what areas you may enjoy more than others by taking courses in other dept.

You may also want to google data science conferences in a particular area and watch/read a few talks to get a sense of what ppl work on (e.g. [r/FInance conference](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2023/05/12/the-15th-annual-r-finance-conference-2023) ). Otherwise, take a mixture of stats and CS classes with a heavier CS component for tech.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Like I said, you are going to be competing against people with experience and you can&#39;t get a &quot;new undergrad&quot; role, you have to go for higher roles. You can also do a masters later, with experience, and you&#39;ll also have more knowledge to actually be able to think how you would apply what you are learning.</p>

1. You can transition from a PhD to industry, it will depend on the market and on you. Some companies will evaluate more you as a PhD some others won't.

I’ve heard from people that phd people are considered overqualified for jobs simply for having a PhD and so they actually find it harder to get work compared to undergrad or masters.

Having a PhD can absolutely make you overqualified for some jobs. Something worth noting - the reason that's a problem is that employers know that after you start working that job, you will quickly want to move on to something more aligned with your background.

Now, the flip side of that, is that there are a lot more industry jobs today that expect grad degrees, and some even require PhDs. So there are definitely jobs that are a good fit for someone with a PhD - especially a good PhD from a good school.

>2: are there any benifits from doing a PhD when it comes to working (i don’t think so but then again I’m not in the industry yet)

There are. The primary one is that doing a PhD basically prepres you to learn whatever the hell you want if you have enough time. The difference between a master's and a PhD is that a masters is a pretty ""guided"" degree - you have a pretty tight degree plan, and your advisor will normally shoulder a lot of the load of helping you figure out a thesis.

A PhD is normally your job to carve out. That means you need to figure out what you need to learn, what to work on, where to make contributions, etc.

Not every company needs that type of skillset, but the companies that need it are not going to get it easily. 

So, anecdotally, I haven't needed someone with a PhD at every company I've worked at, but at some companies I definitely needed someone who was able to go carve out an entirely different approach to a problem, and someone with a PhD was the perfect fit for it.

So, my advice is specific to anyone doing a PhD with a goal to move to non-academic jobs: don't do a PhD based just on the research that interests you. This is the biggest mistake I see people make: they choose the topic that they are passionate about from a purely academic standpoint. With no consideration for what are the practical applications of said work - and guess what? Odds are that a dissertation-worthy research topic has relatively few real-world applications today.

You need to step out of your comfort zone and focus on research areas that have known, immediate practical applications. This is normally going to mean doing work on the ""dirtier"" side of your academic field - the side that people don't normally consider ""top tier journal"" work. And that's fine, because top tier journal publications are useful for academia, not for industry work.

So that's my advice - think of the jobs you want to work, and then figure out what you would want to/could showcase during a dissertation that can convince an employer that you can do that.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>
<p>1: how successful is a transition from research to corporate and company’s thinking your overqualified for the role. I’ve heard from people that phd people are considered overqualified for jobs simply for having a PhD and so they actually find it harder to get work compared to undergrad or masters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having a PhD can absolutely make you overqualified for some jobs. Something worth noting - the reason that&#39;s a problem is that employers know that after you start working that job, you will quickly want to move on to something more aligned with your background.</p>

<p>Now, the flip side of that, is that there are a lot more industry jobs today that expect grad degrees, and some even require PhDs. So there are definitely jobs that are a good fit for someone with a PhD - especially a good PhD from a good school.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2: are there any benifits from doing a PhD when it comes to working (i don’t think so but then again I’m not in the industry yet)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are. The primary one is that doing a PhD basically prepres you to learn whatever the hell you want if you have enough time. The difference between a master&#39;s and a PhD is that a masters is a pretty &quot;guided&quot; degree - you have a pretty tight degree plan, and your advisor will normally shoulder a lot of the load of helping you figure out a thesis.</p>

<p>A PhD is normally your job to carve out. That means you need to figure out what you need to learn, what to work on, where to make contributions, etc.</p>

<p>Not every company needs that type of skillset, but the companies that need it are not going to get it easily. </p>

<p>So, anecdotally, I haven&#39;t needed someone with a PhD at every company I&#39;ve worked at, but at some companies I definitely needed someone who was able to go carve out an entirely different approach to a problem, and someone with a PhD was the perfect fit for it.</p>

Hi All,
So today was another day of interviewing data scientists. Today it was juniors (grads) and journeymen - people who have got 2-3 years under their belt.
I thought I would give some background thoughts and comments - if you are reading this you may well be interested in it.
Context first.
I lead a fairly big data group with platform engineers, data engineers and MI/BI team, an analyitics team and a Data Science team. And I will say that I'm personally fairly strong in the space with a lot of real world experience rather than a nonsense manager talking rubbish from above.
Really importantly - I don't work for a data company or a tech company. I work for a private company in the UK who makes money by doing other things. 99.95% of the staff do not care about data - it's a pain in the backside... they just want to do business and make money. So... at least some of what I say here does not apply for the pure tech space - maybe.
Today I had down selected 34 CV's to 8 interviews and will take two people forwards. Thats.... OK. Don't worry about the other people if you are interviewing though - just be better than them.
Lastly for context - I pay pretty well - top half of the salary band for the north of england, so this is not about ""scraping the bottom of the barrel""
The Basics
-- Wash. Brush your hair. Wear a shirt or a blouse. Smile. Talk about something when we meet - ""how was your weekend""... I'm a human. Breathe.
When you get the job, unless you work at a fancy bank then no one cares what you look like - but it's about playing the game. And the game is ""I know the rules of an interview"". A £10 shirt will get you more points than a £100 tshirt.
-- Women - you are (slightly) already winning
A lot is made of women in Data Science. And thats great, it's a great career. But the reality is that both myself and pretty much all the people in my position automatically assume that a woman is slightly better than an equivilant guy and certainly slightly more pragmatic. Don't worry about the gender thing - you are already very slightly ahead... we WANT the pragmatic and the sensible. Rockstars are a pain in the backside.
The three best hires of my life were all female data scienstists. 5 of the top 10 data scientists in the UK and maybe the world at the moment are female. Just be you.
The Tougher Stuff.
-- Guys.... you have to know your maths
Data Science is about ""Getting Sh** done"" - it's NOT ENOUGH to know a few algorithms and a bit of python and want in on a job. Being REALLY brutal.... I can pick up a regular python developer with 3 years dev experience and have them learn some algorithms and they would be more productive than someone who's in the ""pet algorithm camp"".
You NEED to know your maths. Stats especially - you need REALLY good stats.. And when I say that I do not at all mean *advanced* stats... I mean ""rock solid general stats"". All the basic stuff that gets glossed over. Why are we using a normal distribution when this is an Alpha skew? Why are you using a linear regression for a dynamic system? I need you to know a harmonic mean and when to use it. I really need you to be aware of things like a birthday paradox becuase every manager that you ever help out will NOT know it. Fundementals will ALWAYS beat a nice algorithm.
Biases
Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/5 of the work you get asked to do will be flat out stupid. Mostly because of biases and nonsense thinking. Wikipedia's ""list of biases"" page is amazing. It will save you more time, get you more promotions and save your employer more time than you will EVER achieve with a tweak to a codebase. Go devour it, and then TELL ME WHEN I'M BEING DUMB.
""Here is a nice answer"" gets you good points in an interview
""Here is a nice answer... but you need to be careful about X"" gives you huge points in an answer
Be Fanatical about money
Heres the thing. YOU want a career in data science. Great.... me too. But we are in the extreme minority. The companies paying your salary are interested in results. And those need to be hefty. If you are working for £50k and your company is working on a 25% margin, they need £200,000 of value out of you just to break even.
So... your work is not about the work itself. It's about the OUTCOMES of the work. Make sure when you get asked the interview questions that you are ALWAYS thinking ""whats the end result here?"" and answer that... not just the specific question
""The best algorithm to use in <this case> is X"" ... bad answer
""The best algorithm to use in <this case> is X because of A, B C"" - good answer
""The best algorithm to use in <this case> is X, but it takes a lot of effort, so if we are just exploring a problem I'd probably have a quick check with Y first as it's a 1/2 hour job and will show us the value quickly as a test"" .... amazing answer - consider yourself recuited.
If you are taking online courses like datacamp etc... brilliant. I love to see this. But take the extra 10 hours to do a ""introduction to business basics"" instead or as well - you will leapfrog your peers.
Be Pragmatic
Unless you're working for a tech outfit where data science is their bread and butter, then the task is Getting Stuff Done. FIND YOUR STAKEHOLDER SOME VALUE.
be ready to talk about prototypes. Failing fast. Iteration. Be ready to say ""I don't know but I'd be thinking about X, Y and Z"". How can you take a big problem and break it down into a bunch of small quick tests to see if you are on the right track?
Keep telling me that bad data is death.
The killer of all data science, and the constant frustation of your end users is that bad data wrecks models. I know this... I do this for a living. I *hope* you know this. I really *want* you to know this, but you need to tell me. More than once.
""How would you do X?"" - ""I'd do a PCA and then a quick d/tree to get a view of it"" .... meh... ok
""How would you do X?"" - I'd do a PCA and see if the results seem logical - if they don't then I'd go ask someone to have a look otherwise i'm wasting my time - then I'd do a quick d/tree"" - amazing. AMAZING. Consider yourself the reciepient of a new office pass.
""I Don't Know But......"" gets you almost as many, or sometimes even more points than ""I know this""
Remember that unless you are going for the £100k+ roles you are not assumed to know everything. What worries a hiring manager - a LOT - is someone who can't see their gaps. You are the guys that cause us chaos.
Not knowing the answer in an interview is OK IF you pull it back.
""What's your experience with SVM Classifiers?"" - ""nothing - sorry"" .... ok.. maybe you lose some points
""Whats your experience with SVM Classifers?"" - ""I've heard they are hard and a bit twitchy. If I needed to learn them I'd spend a couple of evenings before hand playing at home with the Iris dataset and SciKit to get a feel for them - so at the moment my experience is low but I think I'd be useful with them in the space of a few days"" - boom - amazing.
Data prep, data prep, data prep
You will spend WAY more of your time doing data prep than actual coding and data science work. A Data Science job is, really, cursing at messy data, fixing messy data and then doing a bit of other stuff along the edges.
Show me you can do it. Show me that you can fix up some data in a data frame. Show me you know why a one hot is important. Show me that you have the basics of SQL.
And if I don't bring it up in the interview - force it into the conversation with me.
Lastly...
Ask me questions. It doesn't matter what - you can literally make them up on the spot or have a handful of questions you use for lots of interviews.. but ask me questions - plural. Partly it's something I'm looking for as part of the interview itself. But partly - it makes you more human. It makes you seem engaged and excited. Ask me HARD questions.... ""Whats the biggest problem you guys have had in the last year?"" ""Whats the biggest challenge I'll find when I join?"" ""What do you wish was different about your data group?""
This was a lot of words.... if anyone has any specific questions then post them and I'll try and respond","<div class=""md""><p>Here’s the original post that inspired the harmonic meme (sorry about the formatting, I’m on mobile)</p>

Its very basic clustering that gets overblown by the consulting side that overpromises but underdelivers. The media amplfied its ""magic"" because they were so willing to go along so nobody questioned whether it was this magic ball people were making it out to be from a tech perspective.  I honestly dont see any proof it provides some huge lift from FBs targeting solution in the first place.

Also it wasnt a FB approved project so at the end of the day it still was likely implemented by providing a connection to Lookalike targeting product.

Similar thing is happening with some of the doom and gloom and magic capabilities attributed to ChatGPT which just sensationalizes to distract from the real issues around chatGPT.

1. test split into something like 80:20
2. within test Perform Nested K Fold which here includes your choice of calibration correction, report generalized error of your model using nested cv results
3. Perform vanilla cv to 'reclaim' the best hyperparameter and calibration configuration  (or analytically inspect the performance over the gird).  You should NEVER report the cv results here.  report the cv results in 2.
4. test on you final hold out, report difference of general error and this final 'validation/test error' (this is kinda optional)
5. (Note-you can bootstrap your performance estimate instead of using CV too, it's pretty fast but the code is kinda tricky-which is why repeated k fold is used in the post above)

This is why you should always be using proper scoring rules, not things like precision or recall in your models (using those conflates a decision making process and a probabilistic modeling process)

Generally speaking, you should be producing models that are well calibrated, because very little of the time are you considering a scenario where there is not a cost associated with probabilities that are either too high or too low.  You generally want a notion of continuity and to be able to  rank probabilities so that you can prioritize the high or low ones well in the context of your problem, while not producing over confidant or under confidant probabilities.

And it's likely not going to be a 'rainbows and unicorns' internship where you get to build predictive/ML models all day long or working on cutting-edge computer vision problems. You might end up doing basic, and I mean VERY basic, EDA for a whole summer on an excel spreadsheet with 500 rows. You gotta start somewhere though. I worked with a DS Masters intern this summer who spent his entire 12 weeks figuring out which of our products are seasonal or non-seasonal. And this was one of the better projects we had for interns.

I think large companies typically offer better ancillary benefits like paying for additional schooling, but I wouldn't expect to get approved for it day 1. My company paid for about 1/2 of my masters in DS, but I had worked there for over a decade and had an overwhelming amount of political capital built up. I could have studied underwater basket weaving and they would have approved it. I think after a year or two of solid work and results most companies that have a tuition reimbursement program would likely support you. 

Also note though that some companies, like mine, will only reimburse up to the IRS limit, which I think was about 8k/yr for a masters. If you go slower then they'll end up paying for more of your degree, but some schools are crazy expensive so you may end up having to pay a good chunk yourself. And you'll be required to stay at that company for a period of time. For me that was at least 1 year, which I would guess is very low compared to other companies' requirements.

1140,ComprehensiveLeg9523,"An intern is temporary. A minor waste of resources, if any. 

What you’re talking about is a literal multiple six figures scholarship on top of fulltime employment. You’ll be very hard pressed to find a firm willing to give you this unless you yourself are that confident in being that rockstar 10x engineer intern convert that the firm really wants.

And then there’s the question of do you want to bond yourself to the firm for x number of years? The firm ain’t stupid. They aren’t giving u a free masters only for you to jump right after that. An offer like that would most likely come with a couple years bond during which you can’t leave no matter what. 

That is far, far different from a return offer. Yes, the firm can be motivated to hire back an intern IF they like the intern enough. But to be THAT motivated? I doubt it, at least not in the over-saturated market we’re in rn.","<div class=""md""><p>An intern is temporary. A minor waste of resources, if any. </p>
