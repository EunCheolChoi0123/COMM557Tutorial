I missed that. Wow, I wonder what that’s like? Seriously I learn so much “cleaning” data. I feel like that’s most of the analysis and making things robust.  

I’m not a tidyverse person but I’m pretty sure it goes beyond data cleaning. Like tidymodels for sure, but I’m pretty sure there’s stuff like tidystats. 

I think if you confidently convey a distain for base R, and put enough hexagons on your Macbook, that should impress the majority of interviewers who don’t code.

For the technical people I seriously have no idea what people want. I’ve been using R for a long time and I’m constantly blown away by peoples work. I thought the tidy thing would be a fad but here we are 6 years almost to the day of the announcement and it’s huge. I thought it was annoying, less readable, fussy and fragile; but then people do amazing work with it, so joke’s on me. 

I visited https://awesome-blogdown.com/ recently and I was reminded of how many people are amazing. I get that there are a few geniuses like Rob Hyndman, but I can’t explain how there are so many talented people. I hate them all. Why can’t they be more mediocre?","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

In my experience, R beginners struggle with things like ""where should I put the curly brackets?""; ""what is a logical condition?""; ""why do I sometimes need to use a while-loop and sometimes a for-loop?"".

Even though I think your discussion is interesting for advanced users and experts, it might be confusing for those who are new to R.

That said, I suggest that you put your comment below the related articles on my homepage and I'm more than happy to mention/link to them at the beginning of those articles to give the more advanced R users the chance to jump into the discussion.

90,Sedawkgrepnewb,"I work in Pharma and use R on a daily basis as an analyst.  This is a pretty recent change as  Pharma is old school and the dominant software to do data analysis was proprietary software called SAS.  Both these languages are focused on statistical analysis and why the part of Pharma that I’m in leans towards R rather than Python.

So I use two languages (SAS and R) plus a lot of bash and do pretty well.  I think being able to use multiple languages is key to better paying jobs

I would say analysts at my company who can use both languages make anywhere between 90-120k plus annual bonus which can be 10-15% depending on level.   Lots of Pharma companies are hiring R programmers right now.

However, you might want to look more at Python if you are early in your career as it has way more job options available (analyst, MLE, SWE, etc).

I want to perform data cleaning, wrangle the untidy real world data into clean, analysis ready data sets, write my own small functions etc. I know, learning takes a lot of patience, time and practice. But what I am looking for is the right approach. &quot;...you just need to find it&quot; actually inspiring. Thank you! I will work on it.</p>

206,AAAAdragon,"The Comprehensive R archive network which is where almost all R packages exist contains a bunch of books on learning how to program in R for free because the books are open-source. I have read a few of them:

There are under documentation contributed section and open-source.

[https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

These books are a little outdated, so anyway Hadley Wickham started the whole set of packages known as a the TidyVerse which contains useful packages like dplyr (for analyzing datasets) and ggplot2 (for plotting data). Anytime you are plotting data you should think about using ggplot2 because the plots are publication quality. You still need to collect good data to publish the results, though. I think Hadley Wickham wrote a book or books on his packages and it is probably free because he is a fan of open-source and he makes money as a professor.

&#x200B;

Also R has built-in datasets like ""iris"" and ""mtcars"" and ""volcano"". Built-in means you don't have to download them so you can analyze real data instead of always simulating fake data. Also the iris dataset is supposed to be analyzed with linear discriminant analysis according to the original publication for which the data was collected.

&#x200B;

Easiest way to use R is Rstudio Graphical User Interface. Easiest way to type is tab completion.

Also, if you want to make web pages it is really easy with ""Shiny"" R package. I did something impressive with Shiny and now a competitor is actively trying to scoop my work and rewrite it in Python because he is so jealous of what Shiny can do in R. That's how good it is.

&#x200B;

Also, R is primarily a functional programming language but it is capable of Object Oriented Programming so most R books don't teach Object Oriented Programming or teach it well at all. For R there is mainly the S3, S4, and R6 systems of object oriented programming. Nobody even mentions R6 but it is super overpowered.

271,Viriaro,"To get you started:

```{r}
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = here(""data"", ""climbers.sqlite""))
```

Replace `SQLite()` by the function specific to whatever DB you are using, and provide the link to your DB. If you don't have a specific one in mind, I'd recommend [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/): `dbConnect(duckdb(), dbdir = "":memory:"")`.

```{r}
dbListTables(con) # List existing tables
```

```{r}
table_name <- ""ascent""
```

You can see a preview of a table with `tbl` (it doesn't pull it in memory though):

```{r}
tbl(con, table_name)
```

You can pull the result in memory with `collect`. Until you collect, all the operations are run within the database. R only generates the SQL code.

```{r}
result1 <- tbl(con, table_name) |> 
  head(10) |> 
  collect()
```

You can create new tables from the result of a Tidyverse pipeline with `compute`:

```{r}
tbl(con, table_name) |> 
  filter(total_score >= 500 & year > 2000) |> 
  arrange(user_id) |> 
  mutate(user_idx = row_number(), .before = 1) |> 
  compute(""ascent_new"")
```

Alternatively, you can execute SQL queries directly from Rmarkdown/Quarto, call R objects within the query, and save the result in a var. You can do even more advanced query generation using `glue::glue_sql`.

But that could well come in time as more packages are developed and/or become well known. The problem for Julia is, ironically, the JIT compiler. Everyone I know, including myself, who just wants to get some stuff done - where the final runtime isn’t the bottle neck - just can’t be doing with how long the JIT can take in certain circumstances.

368,Mooks79,"I have some sympathy with your view. Much of functional programming and the tidyverse approach don’t come naturally to my way of thinking, and ggplot2 is no different for me in that. I spent a long time (years) thinking about it in the way you have - just some obscure functions that make it quite concise to produce some sophisticated plots. I was just using it without really understanding it (and with a lot of stackexchange!). On top of that, you have the fact that ggplot2 has a bespoke object orientated system `ggproto` that it helps to understand. 

I would say I’m starting to move past that, by no means is it all natural for me yet, by really making an effort to think about how the grammar builds around layering aspects of your plot.

So, for example, it’s helpful to think of literally layering a plot in the real world. So let’s say you start with a transparency (if you’re old enough to know what that is!) that is just your axes. Then you add a transparency that is the points `geom_point` then you add another that is a smooth `geom_smooth` and so on. 

But with ggplot2 there are complications that make it a little less clear what is happening. First is inheritance. So `aes` is very important because it’s about defining aesthetics and how each layer will inherit those aesthetics, for example, do you want your points and smooth to have the same colour. Similarly for data/axes transformations.

But the inheritance doesn’t necessarily need to be in the order you’re the code down! So there’s the fact that people often write ggplot2 code in a bit of a back to front order - that masks the layering and inheritance.

How often do you see scale transformations like `scale_x_log10` at the end of the code? So the transformation of the axes (which really should be considered in the first layer - well, the first after defining the plot size) is being defined after all the points have been plotted! Of course ggplot2 knows how to flip that around when actually plotting the image, but it doesn’t help the logic of understanding. 

For me I often do the same as I might only decide I need a transformation after seeing the plot as is first, but then really we should put the transformation into an early section of the code, not tacked on the end. 

In other words examples should be written like:

```
p <- ggplot(data, aes()) +
scale_x_log10() +
geom_point()
```

You could argue the axes transformation need to be defined even before the aesthetics and the data - or before the `ggplot` function call - but that’s something you just have to accept. 

When you combine all those things together, you get examples written using functional programming, object orientated programming, and then written with inheritance/logic going backwards through the code, it’s completely reasonable to be feeling like you are that it seems like there’s nothing but a bunch of obscure programs.

I think you just have to accept that you, like me, are not the type of person for whom these paradigms come naturally enough that it’s easy to understand them all at the same time, for examples written by people who do understand them easily, without a lot of really hard thinking. And even then it’ll still seem weird sometimes!

375,I_just_made,"As someone who has trained a few people on basic R usage and programming, I have heard some statements that are similar to the gist of your post. ""Why would they do X, that seems dumb...""

As another said, tidyverse / ggplot2 are by no means perfect, but they are very logical (and EXCELLENT!) packages that enable high quality, controllable graphics in a ""human-readable"" syntax. I think you need to take a step back and try to see the scenario from a different perspective; instead of thinking, ""I don't understand this, so it must be nonsense and utterly incomprehensible"", try to see the bigger picture and think ""here is something I don't understand, what do I need to read / learn to fill in that understanding, and what could be some of the reasons for doing it this way that I am not seeing.""

Why do I say this? Well, remember, they aren't coding the package for YOUR needs; they are coding generalized applicability. So it becomes a mix of ""power"" and ""usability"". You don't want to have to manual code every aspect of the facet, but if you want to still have control over each aspect, that is going to implement complexity. For every graph where ""space = 'free'"", there is another situation where it wouldn't work. Which do you choose? What do you do?

When I was training someone on git, we had to switch to a branch at one point to do something; if you are familiar with this, you know it switches out the directory structure to match. This person freaked out thinking it deleted their important files. As I tried to talk to them about it and reassure them it is okay, the responses were along the lines of ""That's stupid, there is no point to doing that, it just makes it difficult and scary"". But really, there are very good reasons for doing that, the person just didn't have the experience or the mindset to think of why it would be important. But because it didn't match their needs, they found it a useless and detrimental feature.

So, with that said, I would say that there actually is a user-friendly logic to it. Things are fairly intuitive and once you begin to grasp the grammar of the graphics system, it is largely universal; most of the arguments for one geom are applied to all of the others. They act similarly. I don't think you can ask for better usability without sacrificing power. Your example of ""why call it aes instead of setdata?"" is a great example of why I think you need to take a step back and rethink your position; because the base terminology of aesthetic, or what a graph looks like, doesn't ""make sense"", it is unusable? How would renaming it to setdata change that? This whole problem is solved by understanding that aes(), aesthetic, is going to be the workhorse of most of your graphics.

id recomend taking off the x lab as the labels are self explanatory. i do this with all my data products by date for the most part unless it REALLY needs explaining.

Maybe changing minutes asleep to hours so its easier for the reader to comprehend? Id do somthing like ""Sleep time (Minutes) or Sleep (Hours)"" also.

I love adding + theme\_minimal() i think is the code at the end. looks nicer

The tip to change it to a box plot also would be a great idea.

You can even overlay a regression to it by giving monday a 1 and sunday a 7 to see how it increases / decreases by that. It may show starting week on sunday and ending saturday would be better in this case for people who are 8-5.

or EVEN group by work schedule and see how that affects.

**Programming**:  Sure, knowing how to program is helpful, or how are you going to verify a hypothesis?  And to be fair, there are a few good books in that list, but most of the ""programming"" topics like containers are for data engineer related work.  One of the benefits of exploring it is maybe you'll find a passion for that kind of work.  Data engineers / cloud engineers / infrastructure engineers are the most in demand data roles in the industry right now.

**Machine Learning**:  A data scientist might use ML from time to time, but it's not a key focus.  There are some good topics like A/B testing, and gradient boosted machines, so some of the papers linked are definitely worth checking out.  Exploring ML you might find a passion for tensorflow and deep neural networks.  If you end up liking ML a lot, it opens the door to machine learning engineer work, and it pays better than data science work too.  So, like the previous topic, it opens doors to more job opportunities.

**Leadership & Strategy**:  This is a great topic that is important for data science work, but the book selection does not cover what is ideal for a data scientist to know.  Data science has more to do with learning communication skills (like setting up meetings with different people at the company and figuring out what best benefits the business), how to manage upward, how to make an IT request, and so on.  In short, it's more about learning the business domain than it is outright management skills.  One benefit of exploring the books linked above is you might find a new found love for project management related work, and that too pays quite a bit more than data science work.

What are the most important things for a data scientist to learn, if it is not these three topics?  Outside of learning the business domain / communication skills, basic programming skills, and which ML to choose usually based on how much labeled data you have, the bread and butter or day-to-day typical data science work is cleaning data, pattern matching, and feature engineering.  imo, the best data scientists are the best feature engineers.

R has become my go-to when it comes to EDA and dashboard building (got a cool opportunity to make some dashboards using shiny.. the capabilities and intuitiveness of that setup is amazing). Python is useful for building up more complicated applications and for more advanced machine learning, and at least for me is my go-to language when scripting for cloud purposes.

One thing I was particularly impressed by was the forecasting capabilities. You can perform a grid search of C-optimized models and get good results to spit out instantly (with a little domain knowledge, of course).

559,coip,"I agree with you on many levels. I work for an organization where installing packages and updating R is a nightmare, and so I try to use base R as much as possible for everything. At first this was frustrating, as most examples I encountered online relied heavily on packages, especially tidyverse ones, and I felt like my work was being impaired. 

But now I'm glad I've been forced to use base R. It has made me a better programmer, in general, and a better R programmer, specifically, but it's also made my projects more approachable. Packages are dependencies, and, worse, packages also have dependencies (other packages). Throw all those dependencies into the mix and sprinkle on different version numbers, and so on, and I've found my old projects are a nightmare to deconstruct. Now I look at other people's scripts littered with `library()` calls and it looks so off-putting. In my opinion, every project should strive to use as few external packages as necessary.  

There are definitely some rare instances where piping makes sense, but for the most part, I've found its usage unnecessary. R's basic syntax of inside-out is perfectly readable. It can get messy if one nests too much, and piping can mitigate that sometimes, but, then, again, so could just breaking the code up into separate lines and using assignment operator, which I find preferable to having a jekyll-and-hyde script that jarringly flips back and forth between those two styles. 

I definitely think there is growing fragmentation going on as a result, and I do think this is concerning for the growth of R. I've seen scripts that rely on tidyverse syntax and piping to the extreme where it actually is less economical. Even worse (for me), is when I do seek help online (e.g. on Stack Overflow), almost all of the responses these days seem to require tidyverse, whereas I need a base R solution instead.

The only think I'll probably disagree with you on is your defense of the base `reshape` package. Don't get me wrong--I use it and only it to reshape data frames, but, man, it doesn't matter if I'm going from wide to long or long to wide, those weirdly named sub-parameters like timevar, times, v.names, varying, etc. are just completely unintuitive and every single time I have to re-read the help files and look up vignettes online to figure it out.","<div class=""md""><p>I agree with you on many levels.

In short, Tidyverse is not causing a fracture in the R community. My advice to OP is to try utilizing Tidyverse for a period of time exclusively and objectively assess the experience aside from personal impact or comfort.</p>

579,thunderflow11,"I think there is some truth is this, in that if I knew base R at an expert level, I would probably use it more too. However, I know just enough base R to get the best of both worlds, meaning that in my workflows I seamlessly integrate base R vector operations within the pipe. This gives a robust structure to my R notebooks, where every assignment is like a paragraph in a book, and consequently the book becomes much more human readable. 

The main reasons I am getting more and more entrenched in the tidy ecosystem are:

* More often then not, functions are faster than their base R equivalent
* Tons of convenience functions that relieve cognitive burden and allow me to focus on the actual problem rather than the programmatic implementation
* Functions have better documentation - fewer niche examples and broadly understandable descriptions
* No need to write lengthy for loops, I can map entire data frames in a compact and uniform fashion
* Handling risky behaviour with `purrr` is more practical than with base R, and in general, functional programming solutions are readily available
* With few exceptions, most people I met who predominantly use base R write their code in a way that is SuPEr.CrinGe.2.R3aD. I prefer code that is written_like_this, especially when I debug someone else's code. 
* The above syntactical consistency also allows quick adaptation to new packages that comply with the tidyverse
* Lastly, there is a strong under-appreciation of the tidymodels metapackage. It's too cool for old school statisticians who still use base R, doesn't support the Bayesian models preferred by Stan users, and it's lacking in the new-age neural networks used by those on the ML hype train. But for me, who just wants to understand why one model performs better than another, the ability to just plug-and-play ""engines"" is huge help.

Not everyone agrees with the above.

Personally, I prefer base R. I find I can employ concepts I picked up or learned in other languages more easily in base. In larger organisations dependency free code makes everybodies lives easier. 

With R version 4.1 and the native pipes, I don't think we can use them as an example of something alien seeping into the language, though again, I rarely use pipes myself.

Problems arrise when  a group or organisation gets obsessed with any one method. Absolutely,  there is an argument for standardisation, but sometimes a problem really does justify using a certain approach. I saw an example recently when dealing with 30 million row data sets and an insistance within a group on using tidyverse and nothing else. Data.table clearly provided the best approach to the problem, the expertise to employ it was there, but senior management had decided it was tidyverse or nonthing (disclaimer: yes i know, DTPLYR, but this was a process originally taking hours to run, and time savings were important).

I do find some of the percieved push to use tidyverse when better options exist concerning as the OP suggests. That said, it would also be wrong to insist on base R or any other package. I do feel that some people misunderstand where the tidyverse stops and R starts though. 

As a footnote, Im a big fan of open source and I find the tight relationship between rstudio and tidyverse when rstudio also has a large interest in paid services vs the R core teams interests to be something worth considering. It does sometimes feel like a fork could be made to tidy R one day.

TLDR I think the use of any package and or sticking to base should always consider the best tool for the job, and blindly forcing the use of any method is wrong. That said, I think R users sometimes jump to use packages where the base language is more than sufficient, adding unecessary dependencies and complications.","<div class=""md""><p>The biggest issue I think is any tribalism arrising around any particular approach. </p>

I've only been using R this year, and only because I had to teach a course in it.  I've had a very steep and fast introduction.  For a beginner, one of the most important aspects of any software is good and reliable documentation.  The ideal is to have every single parameter of every function described, with examples and a discussion, and all wrapped in a nice interface.  

I found R's documentation - for my beginner's needs - less than optimal.  Most of it is plain ASCII, and even with the RStudio wrapper it can be confusing.  It was often hard to find what I wanted, and I spent a great deal of time in web searches, and hanging about on R blogs (many of which are excellent).

In this respect, the documentation of the tidyverse is totally commendable.  There is the ""R for Data Science"" book available for free online, as well as the books ""ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis"", and the ""R Graphics Cookbook"".  This is gold for the learner.

629,Mochachinostarchip,"Interesting. So the pre-req for this course is data munging. That is not a computer science pre-req

 there is a big difference in a programming course (computer science) and a statistics modeling course (data science).  You’re teaching the latter but want to adhere to the doctrine of pure programming. But really building models for stats is not the same as programming a package for deployment.  

Your students should have base programming as a prerequisite that covers your concerns. But at the end of the day most students won’t have an intro to programming course if you’re teaching stats for applications. 

building models to present trends on your research is far different then building a API like the tidyverse.. maybe the confusion here is that you want to teach a pure programming course. 

It’s def not fair to hold students who sound like they have little to no computer science background to the standards of them being pro programmers.

660,Agling,"Great books.

Study gets you a good leg up, but ultimately, I don't think anyone can get good at R or any programming language without writing a bunch of programs. No matter how well you feel like you know a language from reading about it, you will find holes in your understanding very quickly when you start solving real problems. If I was starting out, I'd set a goal of writing an R program every day. At first, they will need to be simple, but before long, you will be able to solve pretty serious problems in one sitting.

I actually like to learn by doing a bunch of programming, and then reading books about it. You pick up so much more from the books after you have some hands-on experience. At least, I do.","<div class=""md""><p>Great books.</p>

667,BronzeSpoon89,"Great post, thats how I started in Perl.

I was lucky enough to be able to get a free membership to Data Academy through my professional organization and have been dicking around with that for about 2 months now. Overall id have to say its been a great platform for learning R (also python, sql, and perl if thats your thing). They give you a video on the theory and then give you tasks to complete using the code. Its not going to make you a pro, but it gives you the fundimentals so than you can go off running in your own direction and piece the rest together yourself (aka, google it all).

Although I have sometimes been very frustrated by the vagueness of some of the questions leading me to not being able to complete the task without help, and them on occasion not accepting my code even though it works but its not what they wanted to see, id say if you can afford it or have your employer afford it, its a great resource. There's a zillion different courses on basis, plotting, data analysis, machine learning, etc.

I didn't look at all of your videos to see all of the topics that you cover, but here are some suggestions of topics that might be of interest to viewers: 

* tidyverse in general (particularly plyr, dplyr, tidyr)
* ggplot2 (part of tidyverse but is so special it deserves its own category)
* piping (simple and advanced piping)
* creating custom functions
* shiny apps
* golem (rather advanced application building)
* igraph (maybe also Tnet) (network science programming)
* GGalley/ggnet2 (I don't know if this is still being actively updated or if it has been abandoned but I always wanted an alternative to igraph for networks)
* DT or data.tables or tibble
* webscraping with R

You are much better at R than I am (or at least you can use it much more efficiently), but I still consider myself an advanced R user and my knowledge of plyr, dplyr, and tidyr is still so bad after nearly 3 years of using R  lol. I'm also terrible at piping.

Edit: I'll perhaps add some other topics/packages here as I think of them.

743,azure_i,"The choice between R and Python is about choosing the right tool for the job. 

As you found out, `pandas` and `numpy` are not nearly as good of an experience in Python as R's native, built-in, first party solutions in the form of various statistical functions and data frames. R also excels in the simple fact of having `ggplot2`, one of the best 2D plotting packages you can get (and it plugs in nicely to Plotly to transform your static 2D plot into an interactive app). Statistical and mathematical processing is where R excels, because that is what it was made for. 

On the other hand, your suggestions that R has a nicer syntax is subjective but also naive to an extent. Just wait until you get lost in the nested-function hell that is rampant in R. Trying to use a package like R Shiny is a nightmare because you so easily get lost in a sea of nested `(` and `{`. And the fancy newer operators like `%>%` do not actually make things any better. Not to mention all the little gotchas like the difference between indexing with `[` vs. `[[`, ""strings as factors"", and the plethora of weird magical automatic data type conversions that happen when you convert e.g. a .csv file into a data frame. 

Python is first and foremost a general purpose programming language, and that is what it excels at. Python's object-oriented nature and class system is leagues ahead of anything R has. Libraries like Django and Flask are go-to's for building web app backends across the industry. At one point Python had an RStudio competitor in Rodeo but AFAIK it was bought out by Yhat and then development stopped; not that you actually need an IDE in the first place, for Python all you really need is Sublime Text / Atom / VS Code and a plain old terminal. Also I would suggest that your time spent dealing with `pandas` might have been premature, because 99% of data parsing tasks can be performed on a per-row basis while iterating over a tabular file with Python's `csv` library. You only actually need `pandas` and data frames for operations that require the entire dataset at once; this is an Achilles Heel for a lot of data scientists that attempt to write programs, they get so used to loading all data into dataframes all the time that they end up blowing through their system's memory unnecessarily at times and end up with poorly performing programs because of it.

If your task is to do data analysis, and *only* data analysis, then R is definitely going to be a good choice. However, as soon as you need to start building a more complex program that does things besides just data analysis (for example, a framework to automate your data analysis tasks, hook it into a REST API, configure it with user access permissions, and perform ETL tasks to import/export the data automatically from various external resources and save data into a SQL database, etc. etc.), you are going to be wishing you had used Python instead.

That's a bit of a vague question but in my experience there's really no limit to the types of modeling that can be done. So I guess my answer would be to learn them like most other topics- start at a fundamental level (regressions, classifications, etc.) and then either:

* slowly learn more complex methods once you're comfortable with the previous ones, 

or my personal favorite

* let your progression be guided by the work/school/whatever problems you're facing that cannot be solved with what you currently know
