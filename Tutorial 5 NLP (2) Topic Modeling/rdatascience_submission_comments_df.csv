To get started on your work, you should definitely look into academic research on urban informatics, morphology, environmental data science, etc. There's a ton of data available publicly, as well as urban morphology and informatics packages developed in R and Python.

Yes - go with something you're interested in. Recommendation system, maybe not so much. Couple of ideas (just off the dome no idea if feasible)....

* Concert Setlist Predictor: Based on an artist's previous concerts and recent album releases, predict the setlist for their upcoming concerts.

* Tour Location Predictor/Optimization: Where is the best place to perform and in what order.

* Chord Progression Analysis: Analyze the most common chord progressions in popular music.

* Lyrics Analysis: Sentiment analysis on song lyrics to detect the prevailing emotion in tracks or artist discographies.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

3,,"I got my Masters in IO, first job in the field was a Psychometric Scientist, 2nd job was People Analytics analyst, 3rd job was People Data Scientist. The key here is for you to not try to transition into generic DS roles. You won't be competitive (until you land your first People-centric DA or DS role and build experience). I would suggest focusing on DA or DS roles within People Analytics (also called Workforce Analytics, Talent Science, HR Analytics, etc). Leverage your SME and then use that first Analytics role to build your DA/DS chops and resume. 

Here's the thing - even 10 years out, you'll likely never have an easy time convincing non-People DS HMs to hire you, there's a lot of ignorance and gatekeepers that insist on having a traditional CS/Math/Engineering background. The trick is to find analytical roles where you can be a DS/DA, but in a context that leverages your SME.

Last thing: in a lot of ways, you're lucky. More and more DS roles are realizing that folks with SME are immensely valuable (as opposed to non-industry specific roles).

Junior year: cost analyst at DoD government agency, some stats using distributions, event and hypothesis testing

Senior year: Federal Reserve Data Engineer, integrate map features to FRED, did some forecasting and predictive modeling, a bunch of automation for data cleaning 

Graduate: F100 Data Science entry role, entity resolution labeling using clusters, created automation tool

3 months later (now): starting new role as Data Engineer building pipelines, optimizing them, building dashboards, predictive modeling.

52,SterlingG007,"Yeah, so I have a BS in Geology and after graduating I worked for a year as a lab tech which made me realize that the work was quite dull and pretty much a dead end when it comes to career growth. I went back to get my Masters in Data Science and looked for internships. I applied to around 200 and got no interviews. So if you were in a similar position as me Econ major + non data related job experience then you will have an extremely hard time even getting an internship. My advice is to major in Computer Science or Statistics and try to pick up a data related role. This is to get past the initial screening which will probably be automated. From what I know talking to hiring managers and lurking in this subreddit for a while is that most of them will not even consider majors outside CS or Statistics and will not consider any applicants that do not have relevant experience. Those are the bare minimum for most hiring managers. It doesn't matter how many projects you do. It doesn't matter how Math or Stat heavy your Econ classes are. Most hiring managers have hundreds of applications to go through and don't really have the patience to evaluate your application holistically or look at the projects you did to show what you have learned.    This may be the case in the past when Data Science was new and very few people know about the field but now supply have not only caught up with demand but have actually far exceeded it. This means tough competition at the entry level.","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah, so I have a BS in Geology and after graduating I worked for a year as a lab tech which made me realize that the work was quite dull and pretty much a dead end when it comes to career growth. I went back to get my Masters in Data Science and looked for internships. I applied to around 200 and got no interviews. So if you were in a similar position as me Econ major + non data related job experience then you will have an extremely hard time even getting an internship. My advice is to major in Computer Science or Statistics and try to pick up a data related role. This is to get past the initial screening which will probably be automated. From what I know talking to hiring managers and lurking in this subreddit for a while is that most of them will not even consider majors outside CS or Statistics and will not consider any applicants that do not have relevant experience. Those are the bare minimum for most hiring managers. It doesn&#39;t matter how many projects you do. It doesn&#39;t matter how Math or Stat heavy your Econ classes are. Most hiring managers have hundreds of applications to go through and don&#39;t really have the patience to evaluate your application holistically or look at the projects you did to show what you have learned.    This may be the case in the past when Data Science was new and very few people know about the field but now supply have not only caught up with demand but have actually far exceeded it.

87,ALonelyPlatypus,"I'd be worried about data leakage. It depends what type of fraud you're specifically working with but that's unreal performance for most fraud domains. 

Two things that I've encountered which might find potential leakage.

1. Make sure your train/test split is good. Instead of letting the ML library figure out your train/test randomly, try making your own train test split based on the timestamp. To do this just create the test set from the last few weeks (depending how much labelled data you have you can increase/decrease this) and then train on the data leading up to those data points. 
2. Look at your features, make sure none of them are relying on features that might be different at the time of prediction. For example, your org might assign some type of Fraud Warning"" to an account after they've committed fraud. If that warning is being used as a feature and it leaks into historical data then your model is probably going to take a liking to it and not actually work in practice. Similarly be mindful of features like balance and make sure that they are what the account balance is at the time of the transaction not the current balance (as a negative large current account balance would also be fairly indicative of fraud).","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;d be worried about data leakage.

<p>You can find hundreds of articles talking about this, if you simply google it. Unemployment is absolutely one of the metrics the fed is trying to increase, unemployment is at its lowest rate in decades and not just in the united states.. it is a sign of an overheating economy.</p>

You aren't wrong that a side-effect of rate spikes, especially aggressive rates spikes, will typically result in higher unemployment (or reduced wages) but that isn't the goal.

<p>Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering are both fields that deal with data, but they approach data from slightly different perspectives and often have different primary objectives. Here&#39;s a concise breakdown:</p>

<p><strong>Data Science</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: Extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong>: Strong statistical analysis, data visualization, and data manipulation. Often also requires domain-specific knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: R, Python, SQL, BI tools like Tableau, and sometimes machine learning libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Roles</strong>: Analyzing data to inform business decisions, creating dashboards and visualizations, hypothesis testing, and sometimes building predictive models.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: Design, build, and deploy machine learning models to solve specific tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong>: Deep knowledge in machine learning algorithms, programming (often Python, Java, or C++), and systems integration.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Roles</strong>: Creating ML algorithms, refining and optimizing existing models, deploying models to production, integrating with software and systems.</li>

<p>While there is overlap, particularly when a data scientist is focused on building predictive models, ML engineers tend to be more specialized in building and deploying scalable machine learning solutions. Data scientists often serve as a bridge between the business side and the technical side, interpreting and visualizing data to inform decisions.</p>

179,the_tallest_fish,"Given the size of models and volume of data today, training a model is much more an engineering challenge than a statistical one.

Previously when data and models are small enough to fit into your local machine, you need to employ quite a lot of statistical techniques to compensate for the lack of data or computational power. The bigger set of dataset you get, the more likely you are able to just stack of bunch of random layers in a network and it just works miraculously. The latter case would need an engineer than a scientist.

Big data and large models would need parallel training either in the cloud or a private cluster of servers. This would need a lot of architectural designs to ensure security and robustness in your pipeline, which was previously unnecessary when you build a model locally.

I have no idea why MLOps or DE skills are not included in these JDs, but they really should be.

239,magikarpa1,"Honestly? I think that some people get caught by the name Data Science and taught that the job was about doing some research. DS should be called data engineering because the work is more akin to engineering: deploy models and deliver solutions to increase profit.

Besides that, to do research you need to have a PhD, it does not matter it the research is on industry, one still needs a PhD to do it.

Now, a lot of jobs in DS right now are also closer to business analysis than anything else, I also think that people would expect to work on something more related to what I described on the first paragraph. But the reality is that there are not many positions where this is needed. Once a company have a DE team, a lot of DS job will be business analysis.

One thing that I find somewhat funny is that DS is not an area on itself, still the crash grabbers insist in sell master degrees on DS. What is a master degree in data science? Using statistics to treat data? This is what experimental sciences have been doing since the dawn of time.

I'm saying this because people also should think about doing these courses. If in ten years chatGPT will be able to do all of the business analysis work, what will these people do? Math, CS, physics and etc will still exist. I like to present myself as a mathematician in the industry. I always say this, I work with DS/Ops Research, but I am a mathematician.

I think that some people get caught by the name Data Science and taught that the job was about doing some research. DS should be called data engineering because the work is more akin to engineering: deploy models and deliver solutions to increase profit.</p>

<p>Besides that, to do research you need to have a PhD, it does not matter it the research is on industry, one still needs a PhD to do it.</p>

242,relevantmeemayhere,"I'm gonna come with one of those 'pessimistic'/'complaining' takes. To disclaim  I'm a statistics postgrad (I may have just put a target on my back for some people this sub xD) in the states.  I speak very generally in my movement from retail ds to healthcare, and while I'm happy with my current role-most of my critique is informed by personal experience before my switch to hc 5 ish years ago and just keeping up with industry friends, grad classmates,  and former collaborators.

Data Science in itself...really hard to define.  It's a multidisciplinary field, which in theory presents many opportunities and exciting use cases that can fall under the umbrella.  However, the degree to which a constituent part (engineering, statistics, biz management) is highly variable position to position across all industries.  There is very little quality control in terms of hiring, doing , and branding data science at a company or within the greater corporate environment (industry does really matter tho!)

Part of this is just attributable to 'normal' corpo american stuff.  But one big source of variability that is often very apparent is management's unfamiliarity with basic statistics and experimentation. This translates to pretty different experiences based on your companies' background.  Unfamiliarity with some pretty complicated machinery meets some common behavioral phenomena-the desire to appear the most competent, the desire to push products out as quickly as possible, the desire to *demonstrate* value. Cutting corners is common, accepting results from poorly developed models is common, derision of good practice is pretty common, and the conflation of 'making things more complicated' by controlling for sources of variability in basic design is common (and the irony is that you've made things more complex by not adhering to basic design principles).

One can see that these things are more often than not at odds with properly creating statistical models, both for inference and prediction (I'm distinguishing them here not on purely theoretical grounds-you can create generative models, but depending on your goals your approach will generally have a tradeoff).  Combined with a greater management culture that is stressing near term profits more and more-doing data science often loses a lot of the science part.  Management institutes poor advancement and hiring practices as a result.  Practitioners have a loose criteria for advancement, or dismissal.  This induces a lot of undesirable outcomes and really creates an imbalance of power in the context of selecting, training, and keeping talent.  

Combined with emerging trends such as  an increasing acceptance in some industries that engineering and statistics are interchangeable from a process standpoint and deliverable, speaking truth to power is increasingly difficult.  To a major stakeholder with little technical acumen only sees the output of code-rather than everything else that went into it.  This helps create an environment where sub-optimal decision making becomes the norm, not the exception. 

On a related note, advancement, recognition, and project type allotment is a tough nut to crack for a a lot of people, and in this case it rightly should.  Again, this kind of goes back to management, but it also goes back to senior ds/mentors in their day to day relationships. Your analytical culture/approach will inform business decisions, it will shape business relationships.  And in a context where it is easy for practitioners (especially non stats experts, and evens some of those!) to misapply statistical tools because of a lack of mentorship or sanity checking.  You can find yourself in a position where poor decision making after a model is made comes back to hurt you.  This is very true in the engineering direction as well, which is why we need to do a better job of not conflating the two/valuing the two subject matter experts (among others as well).

Of course, your experience will vary-and depending on industry there is a good chance you are in a nice spot from a 'doing the science perspective'.  But in many places-you are not so lucky, and instead of finding yourself in a environment that embodies good analytical principles, you find yourself in a position where the team is really good at doing something wrong.

There is opportunity in this field here, you just have to be verrrry careful where you want to end up with and who you are working with!

My suggestion that they should do software engineering instead is more directed towards early career people that are frustrated that their jobs are too business heavy and/or don’t involve enough tech.

DS are not out of a job because making the model is a very small part of the role, and you’re not supposed to spend a lot of time on it.

As far as data in the industry goes (research might be closer to your expectations), there are two things you may not have expected from your post. 

** 1. How small of a role modeling is for a DS job. **

A DS solves a business problem with data, and ML is a tool, like a screwdriver. You’re not an technician because you know how to use a screwdriver. You are a technician because you know where to screw, and what type of screw head to use given a context. As a DS, you have to prove that this problem can be improved if you build a model doing X, and convince them how much value it brings to the business. 

> cleaning is the job of data analyst

The job of an analyst is to prove business actionable insights, they are not your data lackeys. Beside, how are they supposed to know how to prepare data for the model you want to build?

In real life, a medium size tech company can have a database with hundreds of tables, each table of hundreds of columns of data. It’s your job to select transform and aggregate these data into potential features to be used in your model, on top of that you also need to know how they are collected and if the values are actually accurate (and they are often not).

** 2. High accuracy on test sets is seldom the most important thing **

In real life, there are 3 datasets to look at:
1. Training set: the model is trained on
2. Validation/test set: the model is evaluated on
3. Serving set: the data that comes in after the model is being deployed 

Doing well on test set seldom promises equal results on serving, because the product changes, user preferences change, data schema changes, trends and correlations change while you spend the extra week just trying to squeeze out 5 extra % on your test set. Model drifting happens more frequently in some industries than others, but you should spend a lot more times to ensure your model stay relevant to future data, not performance on existing data.

Finally, in massive production setting, model performance is very often sacrificed for other priorities. Many places are very very willing to use a model with 80% acc that is half the size of a 90% model.

In production settings, people also look at throughput, latency and costs. There are many models, often massive neural networks that gave stellar performances, but they are slow to do inference, which results in terrible user experience. They may not be parallalizable, which means the model can be very hard/expensive to scale to serve 5-10x the number of users.","<div class=""md""><p>Do you think the DS job is just someone passing you a csv and you make a ML model out of it?

312,anonamen,"A few main reasons. 

Once the problem is defined and structured, data is provided and cleaned, metrics are designed and agreed upon, etc., the work is mostly done. Kaggle does most of the real work for you. The hardest part of a modeling project is usually coming up with a good way to structure and quantify the problem. Things become clear once you've done that. Real work isn't a homework assignment (most of the time). Kaggle is.  

Competing over incremental performance gains has no value in most cases. It's very hard to identify domains where it's useful to do 1% better than most other people. In Kaggle that 1% is hugely valuable. 

Competitions can be useful if they identify novel algorithms or approaches to problems. Kaggle doesn't do this. The public leader-board and kernel system pushes everyone to copy each-other. You tend to get very conventional, brittle solutions that are hyper-optimized towards one particular problem in one exact data split (you can submit a lot of times, and people take advantage of that). Have we really learned anything by discovering that XGBoost (etc) can be optimized and tuned extremely closely to do a very specific thing, if you spend enough time and effort on it?","<div class=""md""><p>A few main reasons. </p>

343,Hungry-Recording-635,"A model that doesn't heavily rely on the input data is essentially a strategy exploiting some form of arbitrage. So what's your goal? Make predictions on past trends? Ofc the data you're using is of primary importance over how you process it, it's literally in the question. Exploit systemic opportunity? Now reasonable modelling for that can be done even on poor data. A model is not just a prediction machine it's also one of optimization now those can be done with good theoretical frameworks too for eg: I coded a Monte Carlo simulation on stock data and calculated optimal portfolio weights based on historical data and then used modern portfolio theory for the same. Interestingly the latter performed better and I was shocked, if MPT was correct the historical data simulation should reflect that too right? Turns out there's a tradeoff between historical dependency and accuracy and if the former is too high and a systematic approach may perform better.

That being said I'll also add that sometimes the data is subject to the model itself i.e complex models fail to capture simple patterns(LSTM vs ARIMA for eg). The key intermediate step is the data processing the model does so the same data can be looked at by 2 different models as entirely different. That would mean the data itself is a dependency of the model making your question strange to answer. There are 3 factors to consider: the quality of the data, power of the model and compatibility of the data with the model your question is undefined on that last part. 

Note: This is strongly in the context of financial data, I do not have the experience to extend these generalizations to other arenas.

349,nextnode,"No - both matter a lot and there are usually more constraints around getting better data than better models. Plenty of situations where you can significantly improve an existing situation with the model rather than data. Greater than both is to consider the actual application.

The discussion is not some ""useless data"" vs ""useful data"". The point is, are you investing in improving data (quality or quantity) or improving models (including the approach). Usually this would be from the state of having something that does better than random at least. Most answers in this thread seem rather pointless in this regard and are probably just repeating wisdoms from eg Andrew Ng.

Those who seem to be strongly data-favored seem to often like that they got a new nice number on an updated dataset while not validating on comparable data that there was a real improvement, which is the measure of success. A good approach rather than a run-of-the-mill net can often cut error rates by eg 3x.

Then OTOH there is also a lot of shallow model iteration done out there which just yields some % and that is not the right way to work either.

Naturally the situation is entirely different depending on if you are forced to work with small faceted datasets not quite containing what you need vs millions of datapoints of exactly what you need.

Then there's plenty of situations where the data and the metrics are not even representative of the use case, and even great improvements without addressing that is rather inconsequential.

350,plhardman,"IMO the important thing is the quality of our understanding of the relationship between data and the process that generated it.

To paraphrase the intro to Wasserman’s “All Of Statistics” (a great albeit terse text, highly recommend having it for reference):

Data science is all about the interplay between data generating processes and the observed data they produce. 

Given a data generating process (I.e. a fully-specified and accurate model of the state of things), we can use probability theory to make statements about the observed data it produces. 

Conversely, given observed data from some unknown process, we need to use our knowledge about the problem space and statistical inference to make statements about the properties of the process that generated the data. 

Data and domain modeling are inextricably linked and it’s shortsighted to think one is more important than the other; they’re two sides of the same coin when it comes to achieving our ultimate goals. This deep, complex relationship is where data science can veer into the realm of an art.

481,cc_apt107,"Burnout is extremely difficult to recover from without fixing the underlying issue in my experience. Sounds like you are not getting the challenge you want from your jobs, but have already tried the obvious of changing jobs a few times. Fair enough?

If so, my suggestion would actually be unrelated to work (at least at first glance): Try to find hobbies, connections, or other things outside of work which get you excited and pursue those. As long as your job isn’t overworking you, a lot of the time, burnout stems from the fact that American work culture makes us wrap so much of our identity in our work. While this is, to some extent, understandable given how much time we spend working, it goes a bit too far in my opinion. Once you start expecting your job to be more than a necessary platform on which you build a life, I think disillusionment, bitterness, and, honestly, an inability to appreciate how good you might have it become inevitable.

Sounds like you are not getting the challenge you want from your jobs, but have already tried the obvious of changing jobs a few times. Fair enough?</p>

<p>If so, my suggestion would actually be unrelated to work (at least at first glance): Try to find hobbies, connections, or other things outside of work which get you excited and pursue those. As long as your job isn’t overworking you, a lot of the time, burnout stems from the fact that American work culture makes us wrap so much of our identity in our work. While this is, to some extent, understandable given how much time we spend working, it goes a bit too far in my opinion.

“A data scientist is a professional who uses their expertise in data analysis, statistics, and programming to extract valuable insights and knowledge from data. Their responsibilities typically include:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering and organizing data from various sources, which may involve cleaning and preprocessing to make it suitable for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis:** Applying statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze data and uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

3. **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations of data through charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate findings effectively.

4. **Model Building:** Developing predictive models and algorithms to solve specific problems or make data-driven decisions.

5. **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducting experiments or A/B tests to validate hypotheses and measure the impact of changes.

6. **Data Interpretation:** Translating complex findings into actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

7. **Programming:** Proficiency in programming languages like Python or R to manipulate data and implement machine learning models.

8. **Domain Knowledge:** Understanding of the industry or domain in which they work to contextualize and interpret data effectively.

9. **Data Ethics:** Ensuring data privacy, compliance with regulations, and ethical use of data.

10. **Communication Skills:** The ability to communicate findings and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

11. **Problem-Solving:** Identifying business problems that can be addressed with data-driven solutions and formulating strategies accordingly.

A data scientist's knowledge base should encompass statistics, machine learning, data manipulation libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy), data visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn), and familiarity with databases and big data technologies.

Yes.  But it would involve one of two things: a) spending time developing a different skillset and/or experience to get promoted, or b) spending time prepping for interviews so you can move laterally to a higher-paying company.  Neither of these things \*need\* to have a major impact on your WLB, but at the same time, they'll still require more effort than just cruising along at your current level on autopilot.  

There's no free lunch.  If you want to keep earning more than whatever your company's yearly raises will be, then you gotta put some work in, somewhere.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

520,MrEloi,"A couple of points:

* Everyone's idea of ""successful"" is different : an equation blending money, travel, technology, WLB, stress, domain, vacation time, pensions, geography etc.
* Don't forget that the 'corporate ladder' is very slippery, and narrows as you climb. You also may move away from your area of work passion as you climb. The ladder near the top has only a few rungs, so even if many start the journey only a handful will reach the top. Do you have what it takes to reach the top? Do you really want to?
* Many/most people will reach a medium level role and stay there, with a decent income and a fair WLB. Firms expect this. It's not any sign of failure.

In my case I was a total workaholic, addicted to new tech developments. I did the climbing the ladder thing and got very close to the top of a major tech firm. I enjoyed every second of it, working in various firms, in various countries across a wide range of domains. In the later part of my tech career I had climbed out of the tech space into the Cxx zone - it was an amazing change of direction/focus .. but certainly not for everyone The downsides were that I did not see my children grow up, I had to fly internationally far too much, and many/most colleagues & friends probably thought that I was an unbearable d\*ck.

577,_Packy_,"2 SD is quite strict. Especially in cases with only few observations.

I think GENERALLY domain knowledge is best. For instance say you use ""working hours (week)"" as a feature. Then, a logical seperation between ""real"" and """"fake"""" data could be 44 hrs. E.g. someone cannot work 400 hrs, such things are likely typos.","<div class=""md""><p>2 SD is quite strict. Especially in cases with only few observations.</p>

578,NFerY,"Could it be possible that you response is in some way incorporated in one of your variables? Also, what are you interested in? Pure prediction or explanatory/inference? Your sample size is very large compared to the number of candidate variable. You likely have colinearity going on, which may or may not be a big problem depending on model choice and ultimate purpose. I can tell that by the presence of five weather related variables. One thing you could attempt doing is redundancy analysis which looks at which variables can be predicted from all combinations of other variables with high confidence. If you're using conventional statistical model, your response suggest it is a count which you may have to deal with a count model (e.g. Poisson). How you deal with categorical variables, again, depends on the ultimate purpose: for inference/explanatory one usually uses dummy variables, for pure prediction, one-hot encoding is more popular.","<div class=""md""><p>Could it be possible that you response is in some way incorporated in one of your variables?
